       "['This is what cinema is supposed to be! Amazing chemistry and acting by both leads, seamless CGI and practical effects to enhance the film, a firecracker script, a true story, pulse pounding soundtrack, booming sound mix, and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! Completely and utterly engaging . So good in fact I saw it twice within 24 hours . Once in Imax and once in Dolby cinema .',\n",
       " \"I was at the Philadelphia Film center premiere on 11/11/19 to view this terrific movie. At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it. I rate this movie a ten and should be nominated for Oscars.\",\n",
       " 'Rating 10/10\\nInspired movie of the year. It is wonderfully made. A good story well told. Tightly written, well acted and directed. I hope Matt Damon and Christian Bale can winning an oscar awards because he already deliver the character very well. Thank you to all of you because make it this movie so amazing . A masterpiece !!',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve seen a lot of car movies, as a self-professed car nut. As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don\\'t provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero\\'s body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.And now enters a film by James Mangold and starring talented actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale called Ford v. Ferrari. My arms crossed, and expectations lowered, I was ready to be disappointed. Although I love Mangold as a director, somehow I assumed there would be a Michael Bay approach to the movie, putting more emphasis on car action sequences than the characters. To my surprise, not only was I dead wrong, but the film became one of the best car movies I had ever seen.Thinking back, I should have known better. Unlike many car action oriented movies, this one is based on a true story, and fact-based dramas tend to take themselves more seriously. It is sort of a shared biopic between legendary sports car designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles. The movie focuses on their efforts to beat Ferrari at Le Mans, a story I\\'m well aware of (like I said, bonafide car nut). And Mangold is an Oscar winning filmmaker collaborating with Oscar winning people such as Damon and Bale.And boy do their talents shine in this movie. The driving engine of the story, if you will, is the loving but at times clashing relationship between Shelby and Miles, portrayed brilliantly by Damon and Bale in a manner that in my opinion is more entertaining and engaging than the dynamic duo of DiCaprio and Pitt in Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood. Damon and Bale have different styles of acting, but both arrive at the same place: creating a character that faces disappointment in the search for victory.Shelby has to come to terms with the disappointment of having to quit his racing career due to heart problems, and creating a winning team at Le Mans is his way of proving to himself he\\'s still a winner. Miles is desperate not to disappoint himself because unlike Shelby, he\\'s never had a shot at winning at a big race. This is due to his abrasive personality, despite an amazing talent on the race track. On top of this, Miles desperately doesn\\'t want to disappoint his wife and son, who support him fervently in his dream. Both characters have their own obstacles in search of escaping disappointment, with Shelby dealing with the suits at Ford and Miles dealing with problems of the car in the race as they present themselves, and the trial of besting the other race car drivers. Their individual struggles intersect in the mutual desire to win at Le Mans, resulting in a brotherhood and mutual love for each other that feels genuine and earned.Henry Ford II, played by a very effective Tracy Letts, reveals in a quick but moving scene why he wants to win at Le Mans. After Shelby takes Ford on a whirlwind nauseating ride with the new race car they have engineered, Ford breaks into tears. Not so much because of the physically jarring experience of being jostled around at breakneck speed, but because of what the car means to his family name. \"I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this,\" he tells Shelby. Damon, in that scene, responds with wet eyes. The character Ford reveals how much he doesn\\'t want to disappoint his family legacy. In fact, the entire endeavor started with an insult from Ferrari, stating, \"You\\'re only Henry Ford the second, you\\'ll never be Henry Ford.\" And in an earlier scene, Ford compares himself to his legendary grandfather in a speech to Ford factory workers concerning his disappointment in current company sales.Cars represent man\\'s desire to chase a dream. Whether it be designing the fastest car, or driving cars the fastest. And despite all the obstacles that may get in man\\'s way, the biggest one is always himself. But with perseverance and the help of others, this obstacle can too be overcome. Ford v. Ferrari manages to get to the heart of this message with deceptive ease and supreme confidence. The film\\'s absolutely gorgeous cinematography and direction capture some of the most amazing car sequences ever put to the big screen. A surprising but believable behind the scenes factoid is that Mangold and the cast are not car nuts at all, and were simply moved to tell the story of the characters. This is why the movie works so well, because they understood the car as supporting the story rather than the other way around.Ford v. Ferrari is an absolute winner, with memorable performances from its cast, and my favorite Mangold picture thus far. For me, it is one of the best of the year, and as far as car movies go, one of the best ever made, and miles away from a disappointment.',\n",
       " \"To start off, I have always hated racing. Yes, hated. It think it's a ridiculous waste of resources, and boring to watch. I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing.. A very whole package overall.To finish off; I am STILL not interested in cars or racing, but this film stands on its own even so.\",\n",
       " 'Just saw F v F at the Telluride Film Festival and it is phenomenal. Perfect performances, incredible visuals and editing, immersive sound, and a riveting story. A real winner. Christian Bale lost 70 pounds Defoe the role and is a delight. Damon is spot on. Catriona Balfe is excellent. All the actors playing Ford executives are excellent as well. Masterful direction from James Mangold. A must see.',\n",
       " \"Ford V Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and for someone who has little interest in cars besides minivans and SUVs, that's saying a lot. Just like the race cars produced by its namesakes, Ford v. Ferrari is sleek and fast; a powerful and expensive machine. A supremely well-balanced combination of corporate rivalry, on-track competitiveness and human drama.\",\n",
       " 'Jesus Christ - Bale does it again.Great script, great casting, incredible acting from everyone, but especially Bale.',\n",
       " \"Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases.\",\n",
       " \"A lot of notes were hit by Ford v Ferrari. The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.The film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.All in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering. I loved about every second of it, despite its long runtime.\",\n",
       " 'The blend of reality, excitement, community, passion, racing all captured very well. Christian Bale, you are just amazing. Huge respect to both Ford and Ferrari. Both Giants of racing.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of \"Ford v Ferrari\". Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver\\'s seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.One of the main strengths of \"Ford v Ferrari\" is that it tells a bunch of different stories within the basic framework. Not only is it the clash that the title anticipates, but also a story of personal redemption for Shelby, one of personal goal-achievement for Miles, and even a healthy dose of \"big corporation screwing over the little guy\" thrown in. All of those angles are very distinct, with nothing muddled along the way. The 2.5 hour runtime really helps with this, allowing such arcs to play out in their entirety.The acting is also incredible from basically the entire cast. Bale gives a unique, quirky performance as seemingly only he can, Damon is solid (as always), and everyone else does their part admirably. Especially affecting are Miles\\' wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe), who both provide much of the sentimental emotions present in the film. A specific scene where Ken explains to Peter exactly what he does on each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets.There\\'s also a never-ending sense of forward momentum and just overall fun to \"Ford v Ferrari\". It never takes itself too seriously, yet it isn\\'t a comedy. It\\'s long, but doesn\\'t feel that way due to the expert pacing--a perfect balance of pulse-pounding action scenes and slower, more emotional scenes within the understated 1960s period feel. Director James Mangold probably deserves a good amount of the credit for making this all congeal together as well as it did.Overall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here. Even if, like I said before, no previously knowledge of racing is present.',\n",
       " \"The Actors were magnificent, fit their characters so well. They're performances added so much to the movie.The story, which obviously is a true tell was emotional and I recommend not looking into anything before seeing the film if you don't know already. Though I'm sure if you know the story you'll still enjoy it.Shot well too. Highly recommend this film.\",\n",
       " 'I love Christian Bale. For each of his roles. But , in this case, I adore him. Because he is real great. Because the\"chemistry \" between him and Matt Damon is perfect. But the film gives more . An admirable portrait of Enzo Ferrari by Remo Girone,fine job of Noah Jupe , Tracy Letts proposing a great Henry Ford II and each scene being admirable crafted. A film about race, family and passion. A special one, in high measure, in profound sense.',\n",

       " \"I was really looking forward to watching this film, but I was disappointed about how Mangold directed it, some overacting, and a too melodramatic script.First, the director expects us to believe that two race car drivers will drive side-by-side giving each other the evil eye while careening down the straight at 210 miles per hour. Better yet, in some early scenes they shout at each other in their open-top race cars, as if they could be heard over the sound of the engines. Mangold also channels Ben-Hur's chariot race, with cars nudging each other sideways. During the Le Mans race, he cuts away multiple times to driver Miles' wife and child watching the event on TV. I'm sorry, but no network then or now would televise a 24-hour race in its entirety. I can almost hear the laughter of anyone in the racing industry who watched all the absurdities (I am sure they would have a longer list than this one).Next, the director did not rein in the outrageous overacting by Christian Bale as Miles. Add in the demonic glowering of Letts as Henry Ford and you have a cartoon, not a well-conceived treatment of an historical event for American racing. As is par for the course with these testosterone-driven movies, the female characters are destined to be background cheerleaders for their men; in this one, there's only one of them.Equal blame then to the scriptwriters, who came up with a predictable plot line in the best (or worst?) tradition of American melodrama. We have the bad guys (Ford and Beebe) and the good guys (Shelby and Miles), and everyone else is window dressing. Not a shred of nuance here, which should be an insult to the moviegoer, but I guess the bar has been set pretty low for decades now.The racing scenes themselves are well-filmed, with lots of low-angle shots that create even more of a feel of being there. A lot of viewers want explosions, and you get more than your fair share of those here -- maybe too many to be realistic.It's unfortunate that in a film of almost epic length you don't get a good exposition of the friendship of Miles and Shelby. Unless I'm wrong, and it just consisted of a lot of bantering and occasional meaningful looks.\",\n",
       " 'This movie is so energy-filled action-packed emotionally-thrilled that engages you and begs for your attention in every single scene. Christian Bale gives yet another brilliant performance and so does Matt Damon and the entire cast. A movie not only for car enthusiasts but for everyone to enjoy.',\n",
       " 'Great story of Miles and Shelby. How they build a car worth risking. Nicely done movie . Emotions, power, engines, speed and CARS. Well done',\n",
       " 'More than the Racing Stuff, loved alot of the Emotional stuff it holds. Yet it offers some Goosebumps in particular the 1st Race of Ken. Unexpected Ending thoughBoth Bale & Demon just Rocks the Role of Ken & Shellby',\n",

       " 'I used to race cars, still spend a bit of time on the track, so I know this story,\\neven met some of the actual people involved here (I\\'m old), and I wanted to really like the movie more than I did. Of course the car porn was fantastic, the casual way in which iconic multi-million dollar cars were placed around the set and even some of the scenes showing the GT40 moving around the airport tarmac were very good. For the latter, they captured speed well here, which is very difficult. So, kudos. But the actual danger involved, although shown to some extent, was not given the attention really needed. I understand the dramatic demands for a movie, but I would think emphasizing the danger would only help. Just to be clear, there were two deaths in a five month period, Miles and Macdonald, although deaths and massive injuries were very common then, these deaths actually had an effect on the racing community. Also, to be clear, the Ford effort was massive, they simply hired the very best in the US to get the GT40 developed. It really was a huge disparity between Ford and any other team. In reality, once Ford got out the kinks, it was a foregone conclusion, no matter that Ferrari made amazing cars. In this regard, little was made of the genius and absolute necessity of Phil Remmington to the entire GT40 project, he was the actual development lead on the car and he was made out to be a Disney -like character, uncle Phil with almost no real role to play. Well, actually, the character of Miles, also an engineer on the project was a compiled character that included \"Rem\" but because Rem was the essential piece for GT40 development, they had to gesture towards him, I suppose. Again, it was an okay movie, very much in the genre, although a bit better acted, Damon and Bale fighting with each other, using food, a thrown wrench, the supportive, loving wife. Within the context of a buddy movie, the movie does work, but its too long and you feel it, although I did like the way Miles death accident was shown, not a lot of buildup, save for the music, and then a highspeed muffled crash, no huge histrionics after and then the both true and movie cliche line \"sometimes they don\\'t come home.\" I wanted more of the internal mechanics of that, I wanted more of Henry Ford crying in the car, a great scene, actually because both the absolute insanity of being in a racing car as well as his joy were conveyed, I thought that was a magnificent human moment, unexpected and worth the movie, on it\\'s own.',\n",
       " 'I like the movie a lot, one of the best in so much a long time, the two lead actors nailed their roles and the story line is so good, effects and CGI are both great and the movie pretty much tells a story of faith and hard work on top of talent.',\n",
       " 'Despite the love affair cinema has had with cars over the years, the sport of motor racing on film has been patchy. Too often the drama on the track has been deluged with melodrama off the track, as in John Frankenheimer\\'s \"Grand Prix\" from 1966. While recent efforts such as Ron Howard\\'s \"Rush\" have brought modern filming techniques to better convey the speed and excitement, it is Steve McQueen\\'s \"Le Mans\" from 1971 that had previously set the bar for realism in the sport. But even there, there were a few off-track love stories to interweave into the action.I wouldn\\'t hesitate to suggest that \"Le Mans \\'66\" is a strong contender for the motor racing high-water mark.The film was marketed as \"Ford v Ferrari\" in the US. (What... do the American distributors think their film-goers are so stupid that if \"Le\" is in the title they will think it sub-titled foreign language??). But it\\'s a valid title, since the movie tells the true story of when Henry Ford... the second... (Tracy Letts) throws his toys out of the pram at Ford\\'s faltering progress. (\"James Bond does not drive a Ford\". \"That\\'s because he\\'s a degenerate!\" snaps back Ford, which kind of typifies the problem\"). Marketing man Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) persuades retired hot-shot racer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to take Ford\\'s blank-cheque to build a car to win the Le Mans 24 hour race.Shelby enlists maverick Brit racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help design and drive the next-generation machine. But neither had banked on the interference of the hoards of Ford suits, led by VP Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). An explosion is imminent! And its not just from the over-heated brake pads!What\\'s really odd about this film is how linear the story is. While we get to see the family life of Miles (to add necessary context to what follows) these are merely minor diversions. There are no sub-plots or flashback scenes. It just relates the history from beginning to end, enlivened by some of the best and most exciting motor-racing footage put to celluloid.At a bladder-testing 152 minutes, this really shouldn\\'t have worked. I should have got bored and restless. But I really didn\\'t.In many ways - bladders aside - I think this will appeal in particular to an older breed of movie-goer. It\\'s a 100% \\'sit back in your seat and enjoy\\' cinema treat.This is the first film Matt Damon and Christian Bale have made together, and I understand that Damon specifically signed on since he wanted to work with Bale. And there is palpable chemistry there. The movie includes one of the best \\'bad-fights\\' since Colin Firth and Hugh Grant locked horns in the Bridget Jones films. And Damon - never one of the most expressive actors in the world - here really shines.Bale also appears to be having a whale of a time. Not having to adopt a US accent suits him, as he blasts and swears his way through various UK-specific expletives that probably passed the US-censors by! He often tends to play characters in movies that are difficult to warm to, but here - although suitably spiky and irascible - the family man really shines through and you feel a real warmth for the guy.There\\'s a strong supporting cast behind the leads, with Tracy Letts\\' fast-driving breakdown being a standout moment. I wonder how many takes they needed on that for Damon to keep a semi-straight face?! Also impressive as the son Peter Miles is Noah Jupe. If you\\'re wondering where the hell you\\'ve seen him before, he was young (Marcus in \"A Quiet Place\").Where the film comes alive is on the track, and a particular shout out should to to the technical teams. Cinematography is by Phedon Papamichael (\"Walk the Line\"), film editing is led by Andrew Buckland and Michael McCusker. And sound mixing - which to my ear was piston-valve perfect - is by Steven Morrow. Also worthy of note is a kick-ass driving soundtrack by Marco Beltrami that genuinely excited. These categories are fearsomly hard to predict in awards season, but you might like to listen out for those names.If I was going to pick at any faults in the film, it would be that Ford exec Leo Beebe is painted a little too much as a \"boo-hiss\" pantomime villain in the piece. It could have been perhaps toned down 20% or so.James Mangold (\"Logan\"; \"Walk the Line\") directs in style. From the rather po-faced trailer, you might think this is a \"car movie that\\'s not for me\". But it really is a tremendously fun movie, with some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments mixed in with edge-of-your-seat action and some heart-rending moments.Above all, this is a film that really benefits from the wide-screen and sound-system that only a big cinema can provide. As such this goes on my \"get out and see it\" list without any hesitation! It\\'s going to make my movies of the year: and I\\'m off to see it again on Saturday!(Read the full graphical review on One Mann\\'s Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks).',\n",
       " \"After being very behind with film watching and reviewing, a lot of my reviews this year being dedicated to individual episodes of shows, completest quests and some cartoons, finally made the decision to watch more films released this year and to finally review the films seen earlier this year but hadn't gotten round to seeing. 'Le Mans 66' was a very eagerly anticipated film, due to liking the lead actors and loving 'Rush' that this has been compared to by some, and one of the year's (quite hit and miss) more acclaimed films, so there was not any doubt about seeing it.'Le Mans 66' (often advertised though under the easier to remember title of 'Ford v Ferrari') doesn't disappoint a vast majority of the time, almost everything is right with it. Found it an exceptionally well made, acted, written and enthralling film and one of the year's must sees, also one of the few films this year where the advertising actually did it justice which is such a rarity in film (having lost count of the number of great films that were criminally mismarketed or misleadingly so). Seeing as 2019 has been another hit and miss year, with a fair share of good to brilliant films, a fair share of mediocre films or less (including clunkers) and films sitting in between, that is saying a fair bit actually and am not trying to sound like a snob here.It isn't without its flaws, though they are hardly any. Did find the character of Peter and his scenes rather too twee for my liking, like when the film cutaways to him where he pointlessly explains the action. 'Le Mans 66' already had a lot of emotional impact of all kinds, the character and his presence just didn't seem necessary.Maybe it is a little too long too, it could easily have done with being perhaps 15 minutes shorter and lessening or excising Peter's role would have made things better.However, 'Le Mans 66' looks great. Especially the editing, which is actually quite astonishing in the action-oriented scenes and can see some kind of nod for Best Editing at any of the big awards. Likewise with the sound editing, which is quite striking in its authenticity, 'Le Mans 66' capturing the spirit of the sport and the personal lives behind it beautifully. James Mangold's direction is stylish throughout, the action-oriented scenes have plenty of thrills and mostly the personal lives scenes are emotionally investable.Script is tightly structured and is nicely balanced. The story is always well balanced and some twee moments aside is always compelling. The climactic race is absolutely thrilling in every sense of the word. All the performances are spot on, with Matt Damon giving one of his better and most good-natured performances and Tracy Letts excels in his role, especially in his post-drive breakdown and his frankness during the Ford executive presentation. Best of all is Christian Bale in the film's most demanding role, he captures the uncomprimising attitude needed brilliantly.All in all, excellent and one of 2019's highlights when it comes to film. 9/10\",\n",

It tells the story of how carol shelby and ken miles built a car that could beat Ferrari in 24hr race at Le Mans where they had won the previous 4 years.

Matt Damon does a great job as Shelby but can't help be overshadowed by Christian Bale who steals the movie with his performance as ken miles a man on the journey to find that one perfect lap. James Mangold does a good job with the direction you feel the gear shifts & the tension when the Ford Gt40 screeches it's breaks around right corners. There could probably more ambitious or creative shots in some of the races but in my honest opinion I think the performances Mangold got out of this cast outshines the technical stuff. The writing isn't the best and can come off as cheesy & predictable in certain areas but for the most part I felt it was well written and had a good pace to it. I'd recommend Le Mans '66 it's not 1st place but it's a near perfect lap.\",\n",
       " 'Once in a while, a big Hollywood film is made with big Hollywood stars, and big Hollywood production values and occasionally everything works to deliver a dynamic cinematic event.\\nSuch is the case with director James Mangold\\'s new film \"Ford v Ferrari\". Armed with superior talent in front and behind the camera, Mr. Mangold has directed his best film yet with bravado. A strong screenplay is the foundation of a great story involving the characters portrayed by Matt Damon playing American Car Designer Carroll Shelby, driver Christian Bale, and Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, all involved in challenging the famous Italian car maker Ferrari at the famous race at Le Mans in 1966.\\nFrom the very first frame, James Mangold sets the tone with exciting, bold and energetic images that are visually arresting, alongside a great score that never overwhelms or feels generic. The editing is outstanding, as the pace is so fast moving, pulsating with nail biting excitement, especially in the racing sequences.\\nCinematographer Phedon Papamichael, along with Production Designer Francois Audouy, and Costume Designer Daniel Orlandi, have created a rich canvas, always authentic in feel, full of subtleties resulting in a formidable palette that comes together beautifully.\\nFlawless performances are a high point under the guidance of James Mangold\\'s direction. Matt Damon has rarely had the opportunity to show quite a range from confidant showman to a vulnerability we rarely see. Christian Bale as always disappears into his character and delivers another stellar performance, and Tracy Letts layers his performance with strength and flair.\\nUltimately, James Mangold\\'s master work delivers on all fronts, and on the whole one of the most satisfying films of the year, and certain to be a major contender for many well deserved awards !',\n",
       " \"The Movie is brilliantly edited With an all cast Christian Bale & Matt Damon together its a perfect match for likeness of their characters. Matt Damon has certainly grown as an actor with versatility and we all know Christian Bale Becomes any character he portrays and is well suited to play another amazing man, Ken Miles. I love how they showed us the true Politics of the Motor Industry. Great true story, but as a Ford lover, Ford couldn't see the Forest through the trees! If wasn't for Miles And even then!!!\",\n",

My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time I was watching it.\\nThe plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive visionary Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale), who are dispatched by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) with the mission of building the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France.\\nChristian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Jon Bernthal shows that he is more than an action guy when it comes to his acting capabilities, and Josh Lucas might just be the evillest villain to come out of 2019, including Thanos himself. What a dick he is in this movie and he plays it to perfection.\\nJames Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails. The race scenes have the tension they need, and Matt Damon and Christian Bale bring the humor without over doing it.\\nOverall, this is entertainment at its finest. There are some true story films that don't relate well to the big screen, this one will excel expectations. Great direction with a phenomenal cast is an A+.\\n5/5\",\n",
       " \"Such a fun, engaging movie. I saw some critics say it was too long, but for someone who takes sometimes several additional hours, days, even, to get through a movie due to ADD and a short attention span, this film raced by.The character work with Miles was so great as to get the viewer on his side from the start, and Bale's performance was exactly what the movie needed to create a guy in which we're so invested. It's the combination of passion, skill, and knowledgeability that makes Ken Miles THE guy to root for.Matt Damon was good, however I think he could be replaced with virtually any other actor and the movie would be unchanged.The character building we are given before, the villainization of the Ford team; they inject the racing sequences with the same suspense and adrenaline present when your home team is fighting for a championship title. We not only have a favorite, we have rivals.And oh, what a twist--what a soul-crushing twist. I almost couldn't finish the movie. I had to look up whether it was real in the hopes that it wasn't. It's one of those times that you just wished based on a true story was fiction so as to console yourself.\",\n",

       " \"The story of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles gets the Hollywood treatment in this nostalgic look at the motor racing scene of the 60's. It also succeeds in harking back to the kind of films Hollywood doesn't make any more.Although this is in many ways a standard three act rise, fall and rise again narrative it's elevated by the excellent central and supporting performances. Damon is on top form as the bullish and ambitious good ol' boy Shelby. Compensating for his own enforced retirement as a driver by building up a successful race car construction company.Bale, as ever, gives a memorable portrayal as the flawed genius Ken Miles. Quick tempered but never nasty, a loveable rogue and family man whose own driving career could clearly have been one of true greatness if not for his inability to compromise or bite his tongue.The two leads rock and roll throughout proceedings, quick to clash but quick to make up again and once on board with the Ford motor company (who are desperate to end Ferrari's dominance of the Le Mans) the film really cooks.The Ford suits are played fairly stereotypically but Josh Lucas is the film's real hissable villain. Playing the smarmy exec role to perfection.Events play out much as you would expect but no less entertaining for it. Even the somewhat cliched speeches and corny English asides (all English people love cups of tea and say Cor Blimey!) Don't detract from the thrills.The racing scenes are noisy and muscular, visceral in the same way as Ron Howard's Rush and put you right in the driving seat. And the final race is the highlight. Here the story even manages a slight twist I didn't see coming and stops the film veering into well worn ground.Top notch stuff, well worth watching.\",\n",

       " 'This film is like the cars it portrays. Slick on the surface, but complicated underneath. Yes it\\'s a story born of corporate ambition in horn rimmed glasses and dark suits, driven by pride and stubbornness, but the heart of it is pure racing, to hell with money, marketing, good looks, any of that. I\\'ve watched half of this with my foot planted to the floor. The driving scenes are awesome, the roar of untamed engines (turn your sound up as loud as you dare!), shifting gears into blindness inducing speeds. Fast cars alone though can\\'t carry a film, but thankfully the cast here is as great as the cars. Damon is very good as the lynchpin Shelby, as he drags Ford away from mass production and onto the racetrack to challenge Ferrari\\'s dominance. Bale though, Bale is magnificent. His portrayal of somewhat renegade driver Ken Miles is the oil in the engine, the comic undertones with a \\'my way or the highway\\' attitude. He literally drives this. The pacing is spot on, balancing the boardroom with the tarmac perfectly, all done with some Oceans 11 style slick, good ol rock n roll blasting out as men do manly things. It\\'s a show piece with Ferrari painted as the bad guy. I\\'m fine with that. Yes the cars look sexy, \"If this were a beauty pageant, we just lost\", but gimme the brute force of the Ford GT40 any day. There\\'s a ton of excitement and energy before the cars even get to Le Mans, but seeing that GT tear up the French countryside gets the heart pounding. Doesn\\'t matter that I already knew the outcome, it\\'s still exhilarating with some of the best racing scenes in any film, ever!',\n",

Script is fine, director did great solid 8\",\n",

There's nothing subtle here, though I did like Marmite product placement.\",\n",

Marketing VP Lee Iacocca has the idea to enter the race. They first try to buy Ferrari and Enzo Ferrari insults Henry Ford II. Iacocca recruits Shelby to create a racing car and Shelby recruits Miles to be his driver.This is an old fashion rip roaring good times. Damon and Bale are great. All the actors are great whether it's Tracy Letts being told that he's not Henry Ford or the villainy of Josh Lucas. It's a solid sports underdog story. It's fun like Caitriona Balfe driving crazy. The race is thrilling. It is a perfectly made old fashion movie.\",\n",
       " \"James Mangold directs this historic visit to the 1960s, using the script written by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, and the result is a heart-pounding series of fast car racing events that surface as an entertaining film due to the presence of some very fine actors. Not only is it a recreation of the 1966 Le Mans event: it is also a penetrating statement about corporate behavior attempting to drown individual personal achievement!Briefly, American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build a revolutionary race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. The 'Ford' tent includes Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), and Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), and the Ferrari group is lead by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). Significant roles include Ken's wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and their son Peter Miles (Noah Jupe), as well as Shelby's right hand man Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon).But towering over the entire epic are the acting chops of Mat Damon and Christian Bale, both of whom create fully three-dimensional roles that make the story come vividly to life. The film is overly long and at times self indulgent, but for fans of fast cars - and racing history - this film will more than satisfy.\",\n",
       " 'You don\\'t have to be a race car enthusiast to enjoy this film. I\\'m certainly not, having neither the desire or the patience to watch daring motor cars race around a track at mind boggling speeds. Though you do have to credit the drivers who enjoy the profession; it takes a certain amount of bravura and stamina to withstand the pace and stress forces that go with the territory. Without knowing the story in advance, I thought it was going to pit Matt Damon against Christian Bale as opposing drivers, but that idea was quickly put to rest. The legendary Carroll Shelby (Damon) is in the spotlight here as the former racer and design engineer recruited by the Ford Motor Company to build a championship vehicle. In no small measure was it Ford\\'s response to a snub by Italian car maker, Enzo Ferrari, who turned down a merger with the American company in a fit of pique. Had he gone along, the end result in the picture may never have occurred.The movie will call to mind the Steve McQueen race car epic \"Le Mans\" from 1971. With a half century separating the two films, both reliably capture the spirit and flavor of the world\\'s longest endurance test. \"Le Mans\" has more of a documentary type feel than the movie under consideration here, with less of a plot and straightforward story line. Building up to the seminal race in 1966 featured in this film, the story takes an introspective look at the machinations of the Ford Motor Company to control all aspects of engineering a vehicle they hope to defeat the Italians with. Not to mention the politics and marketing aspect of selecting a driver who wouldn\\'t embarrass the company by going public with any developmental problems along the way.For fans and non-fans alike, the racing scenes are thrilling and adrenaline inducing. As driver Ken Mills, Christian Bale exudes nerves of steel and a soaring passion to be the best driver out there, achieving mind boggling speeds that would otherwise strike fear in the hearts of most mortal men. That was comically illustrated in the one scene in which Shelby himself took Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) for a \\'spin\\' in a car under development. If there\\'s any sense of a let down with the picture, it would have to be the screw job Mills suffered when he agreed to bring in all three of Ford\\'s race cars to the finish line together at Le Mans. Realizing it, Mills bore the slight with dignity, knowing in his heart that he was the best driver out there that day, and nothing could take that away from him.',\n",

The future is not too bright for Miles Ford and Ferrari but unlike Miles he does not hold the cards in life.. When people in high places determine people's fate, trusting a friend who is controlled by such is not that easy. But the Miles-Shellby bond is a prime example of great casting. In the end, your fate is determined by people in suits; mirroring why unchecked heights of inequality can determine people's fate in our this era.

       " 'Based on A.J. Baime\\'s Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans (2009), written by Jason Keller, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth, and directed by James Mangold, Le Mans \\'66 (released in North American with the equally generic title of Ford v Ferrari) counts Michael Mann as an executive producer. This is notable, as Mann himself has been trying to bring an adaptation of Brock Yates\\'s Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races (1991) to the screen since at least 1993. Indeed, at one point, Mann\\'s Enzo Ferrari was set to star Christian Bale, before he was replaced with Hugh Jackman. Whether or not it will ever be made is open to speculation, but it seems unlikely in the wake of Mann\\'s involvement with Le Mans \\'66, an excellently made but unadventurous movie.Mangold is a fine director, but he\\'s no Mann, nowhere near, and the film did, to a certain extent, leave me pondering what kind of kinetic brilliance Mann would have brought to similar material. In contrast to Mann\\'s body of work, Le Mans \\'66 could never be accused of breaking any new ground or trying anything especially original - it hits all the beats, it hits them well, but it never strays from the formula. Looking at issues such as friendship, male pride, personal integrity, sticking it to the Man, art v commerce, individuals v corporations; it is, in essence, a thematically broad and aesthetically anonymous pre-auteur theory audience-pleaser made with the technology and aesthetic sensibilities of modernity. And whilst the individual parts may be unsatisfactorily safe and familiar, the whole is unexpectedly accomplished and immensely enjoyable.The film begins in 1959 as Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) wins that year\\'s Le Mans, only to be told he has a heart condition and must stop racing. Cut to 1963, and Henry Ford II (a superb Tracy Letts, who steals every scene he\\'s in) has just had an offer to purchase Ferrari rejected and been personally insulted by Ferrari himself (Remo Girone). Livid, Ford II determines to build a car capable of winning Le Mans, which Ferrari has won in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Ford Vice President and General Manager Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) contacts Shelby, the last non-Ferrari driver to have won the event, and asks him to design a car. He gets to work but says they\\'ll need a great driver as well as a well-designed car. He reaches out to Ken Miles (Bale), who has a reputation as one of the best drivers in the world, and is renowned for his almost supernatural ability to identify problems in test cars after only one or two laps. However, because of his volatility and unpredictable personality, few want to work with him. He comes on board, but immediately clashes with the Ford executives, particularly Senior Executive Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).Le Mans \\'66 is somewhat similar to Michael Mann\\'s Ali (2001), insofar as it uses the grandiose moments of history to tell an intimate story - Mangold uses the determination to win Le Mans \\'66 as the background against which to examine issues such as friendship and the clash between gifted individuals for whom success is its own reward and corporations who don\\'t see value in anything unless it\\'s monetarily successful. Indeed, the argument could be made that the film is actually a commentary on the Hollywood studio system, with Shelby and Miles representing independent filmmakers who love the craft and see the medium as an art-form, whilst the Ford executives represent the studio, always more concerned with the bottom dollar than artistic integrity, always getting in the way of the people who, if left alone to work, could produce something spectacular (we\\'ll ignore the fact that the whole thing feels like it was made by an algorithm designed to hit as many clichéd feel-good moments as possible).The film is also extremely funny in places, especially in a scene where Shelby shows up at Miles\\'s house, and the two get into a fight on the street. Miles\\'s wife Mollie (an underused Caitriona Balfe) emerges from the house, looks at the two men fighting, goes back inside, and remerges with a garden chair, a drink, and a copy of Better Living. She then sits down to watch the action. It\\'s a hilarious moment, but it\\'s one with great thematic importance - this is very much an androcentric world (Mollie is virtually the only female in the entire film), but for this brief moment, the audience is allowed to pull back and laugh at the utter ridiculousness of competitive maleness - boys will be clichéd boys, always trying to outdo each other, and getting all worked up over something as pointless as a fast car.This thematic focus, however, is not to say the film ignores the intricacies of racing; on the contrary, there\\'s a huge amount of techno-babble concerning vectors, aerodynamics, the mathematics of torque, the torsion of metal, and the ins and outs of physics. Additionally, although thematically, the focus isn\\'t on the races themselves, there\\'s no denying that the aesthetic design of these scenes is exemplary, albeit familiar. Mann would have done wonders here, but Mangold, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, and sound designers David Giammarco and Jay Wilkinson have crafted some truly intense moments. For the most part, Mangold and Papamichael avoid any objective shots (for example, there are no overheads giving us a good vantage of the entire race), and there are very few shots showing us something that Miles is unable to see. The scenes aren\\'t shot in the first-person, but our vision is anchored to his. This, of course, contributes to a subjective focalisation and creates the sense of being in the car with him, which brings a default level of intensity, as well as giving the viewer a perfect vantage point from which to see just how fast these guys are going and how difficult what they do actually is.In terms of problems, there are only two of significance. The first concerns just how safe and rudimentary the film is. Aesthetically, although the race scenes are kinetic and exciting, there isn\\'t anything new or inventive in them; thematically, the film doesn\\'t say anything we haven\\'t heard before; and structurally, it walks a very well-worn path - chances are that everything that you think might happen in Le Mans \\'66 does happen. This is your basic underdog story, and it adheres rigidly to that template. The character of Beebe is a good example of just how rigidly. In essence, he\\'s a poorly written token villain because you can\\'t have an underdog story without a token villain (usually in the form of bureaucratic interference). In this case, when Mangold feels the need to inject some conflict into proceedings, Beebe will pop up to throw a wrench into the works. His motivation? Apart from some brief references to how he doesn\\'t think Miles is a \"Ford man\", his antipathy is never explained - the character is a Swiss army knife villain who can be used for multiple purposes, a one-size-fits-all bad guy without an iota of nuance or interiority. The second problem concerns Shelby himself, who is disappointingly one-dimensional (at best), as we learn absolutely nothing about his personal life - for example, the film makes no reference to the fact that by 1963 he was on wife number three (of seven!). Who is the film\\'s Carroll Shelby, and why should non-racing fans care about him? We never get an answer - he\\'s Matt Damon wearing a Stetson and speaking with a Texas drawl. And that\\'s about all the character development he gets.Although these issues are significant in isolation, the thing about Le Mans \\'66 is that it\\'s so well made, it rises above the clichéd and overly-familiar nature of many of the individual scenes, resulting in a whole that is very much more than the sum of its parts. A film about friendship and integrity rather than racing, it doesn\\'t take any risks, nor does it bend any rules. Indeed it does nothing that could be labelled innovative. For all that, however, I couldn\\'t help but enjoy it. It won\\'t surprise you, it probably won\\'t move you, it certainly won\\'t change your life, but the storytelling is clear and refined, and the journey is one well worth taking.',\n",

Enjoyable action performed by masterful actors woven into a meaningful story. Friendship, challenge and trust all displayed in a way that I could enjoy. Trial and error engineering before computers took over the decision process ... wow what a magical time to be alive. The Le Mans wins by the Ford GT40 on 66, 67, 68 and 69 ... epic effort and akin to the first Moon landing as far as motor sports is concerned.

For a long movie, it went by quickly. The writing THANK GOD was perfect. There are so many awful movies and TV shows with some of the worst writing I've ever heard.

Most of all the ever-present protagonist-driver-changes-gear-and-reveals-that-he-hadn't-floored-the-accelerator-until-now stupidity. In fact they repeat this once every five minutes. And of course the drivers' ability to look over at other drivers for seconds at a time while they sit in a race car that does 974 km/h! Oh and of course the Hollywood cliche that never fails: Le Mans drivers that drive like it's stock car racing. Slamming into each other, going off the road intentionally, spinning and crashing out in epic fireballs ... they are all there in their vomit inducing glory. There's the totally unrealistic racing environment, handling of the race cars, driver and pit crew behaviour, a totally unbelievable person gallery and a farcical historical depiction. And of course there is the oh-so-evil suit and tie wearing villains and the oh-so-good heroes, which we are supposed to believe actually existed.Sigh!

It's as if he didn't exist. WTF ?!The largely hammy acting by Christian Bale also a let down as Miles' brummie accent sounded more like cockney in Bale's portrayal. Really poor dialogue and not even close to the real story.

It has staked out a philosophical position and sets about defending that position within the context of an engaging movie plot. I immediately think of Ghostbusters (1984) as having that philosophy as an easily overlooked component to what makes the movie so great. Fine performances all around and solid pacing sell this point of view while making sure it never overwhelms the movie and becomes preachy. Great movie. it'll be neat to see how it's reputation fares as the years and decades begin piling up. Don't have to be a racing fan to love this.\",\n",
       " 'The Ford Motor Company is said to be masters in taking up challenges. In its giant plant, Willow Plant with its one-mile-long assembling line, the company managed to produce B-24 Liberator bombers at the rate of one plane per hour. This was their contribution to the World War 2 efforts to liberate the American soil and their European cousins from tyranny. The company established a reputation for themselves as \"the arsenal of democracy\" by transforming their production lines to make aeroplanes, tanks and trucks for the armies that defeated Adolf Hitler. They were a pioneer of sorts as women worked in the assembly line and were paid equal wages with men. It, wittingly or unwittingly, to also become \"the arsenal of fascism.\" for its substantial business deals in Nazi Germany. But that is another story for another time.By the end of WW2, Henry Ford\\'s grandson, Henry Ford II had taken over Ford Motors. He adopted an aggressive business style. When his bid to buy over Ferrari met a dead end, he went ballistic. He made his personal mission to show his dominance in the motor industry.In the early sixties, Ferrari was overrunning the racing tracks. For six years, back to back, from 1960 to 1965, it won the Le Mans 24 hours endurance race.Ford II, through his agents, went on a headhunt to recruit the best racers to beat Ferrari in Le Mans and show them who the boss was. That is where this film fits in. It narrates the story of two American racers - Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby- in a dramatic twist which saw Ford Motor Company finish the Le Man Race in a podium finish.\\nThis film is not just a run-of-mill offering that depicts the expected David vs Goliath scenario where David comes out tops despite all the disadvantages, and everybody is happy. It offers much more than that. The characters are rich. The chemistry between Miles, a war veteran British émigré who is a lowly mechanic because of his short fuse, and Shelby, a sports car salesman who himself was a race winner, is phenomenal.What makes it more interesting is the controversy surrounding the final outcome of the race and the mystery surrounding Miles\\' crash during practice at the end of the film.They say jealousy and greed are unfavourable traits. Clearly, this is not always the case. Many innovative inventions and groundbreaking feats have been achieved through our rapacious desire to dominate and tower over our fellow brothers.',\n",

In order to boost sales, Ford aims to win the Le Mans 24-hour race, a race dominated by Ferrari over the last few years. To head their team they call in Carroll Shelby, who won Le Mans in 1959. He in turn makes Ken Miles his chief test driver. Together they make a formidable team. However, it is not just Ferrari they have to worry about. Office politics and powerplays within Ford are an even greater threat to the success of the project.I did not have high hopes for this movie before watching it. Despite it being nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, it seemed just like a conventional revhead movie. Turns out, it's better than that, far better than that.Director James Mangold crafts a story that is highly engaging and very fast-paced. You wouldn't know the movie is 2 ½ hours long it is so engrossing: the time speeds by. The racing scenes are amazing, capturing the pace, danger and excitement of motor racing. Throw in good performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale and you have a first-rate movie.Not perfect though. I found the political machinations a bit of a drag and contrived-feeling (even though many of them were true!). While Christian Bale puts in a good performance as Ken Miles, Miles's character is drawn rather stereotypically English, complete with ever-present cups of tea. It seemed a bit trite.Overall: highly entertaining. Don't be put off by the movie's duration: the time whizzes by.\",\n",

       " \"Ford v Ferrari is a biographical drama film directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk The Line, Girl, Interrupted). Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, it is a well-told story that balances high octane car races with genuine drama.In 1963, the Ford Motor Company recruits famous racecar driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to assist them with designing a car that will help them beat their arch rivals Ferrari at the Le Mons race in France. To aid him with such a task, Carroll decides to enlist the help of British mechanic and fellow racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to test for any flaws and eventually race in the finished product itself. At first, the two of them make great progress, however Ken's brash personality and blunt honesty puts him at odds with the higher ups at Ford, causing the company to believe he may not be the right person to be racing their car and representing them abroad.With its fast pacing and heartfelt drama to match, Ford v Ferrari rises above the typical car racing film to become one of the most interesting portraits of an intense rivalry in recent memory. The film isn't so much about the cars themselves as as it is about staying relevant in the public eye and maintaining a respectable image. From the very beginning, we are given the idea of how desperate Ford are to shake off their reputation of being perceived as making outdated cars that only one's grandparents would drive. This is juxtaposed with the cool and hip-looking Ferrari being presented as more appealing to younger potential motorists. The resulting races are used to further the film's plot and aren't merely there for mindless entertainment. While it may be obvious to some viewers what the eventual outcome truly is, it is certainly a lot of fun anticipating what happens along the way.Director James Mangold successfully strikes the correct balance between car racing action and realistic human drama, so much so that virtually all audiences should be able to find something to be entertained by. His choices in editing and cinematography help move the film along at a breathless speed as we watch cars zoom past at high acceleration, sometimes resulting in some intense crash scenes. There are times though, where some of the mechanical jargon may prove confusing to non-racing enthusiasts such as myself as I did end up scratching my head at a few scenes where certain important car parts were being discussed by the characters. In addition to this, I wasn't quite sure about how some of the rules of the race track were showcased in the film, as it felt somewhat glanced over. Fortunately, these moments are infrequent and are often counteracted by the great acting of the film's leads.Christian Bale is such a joy to watch as Ken Miles, the unapologetic perfectionist racer who wants to push the limits of what a car can do. It caught me off-guard at first hearing him use his native British accent while surrounded by other Americans as I am so used to seeing him play only American characters. Matt Damon gave a nice performance as well, but I feel that he was overshadowed by Bale in most scenes. This is due to Damon essentially being the straight man to Bale's outspoken antics which did cause me to focus more on Bale instead.Overall, even if you aren't a huge fan of car racing films like me, this one contains more than enough entertainment to satisfy even the most car illiterate of audiences. The historic value of the depicted event makes for a solid drama and could possibly bring a newfound amount of respect to this genre in the near future.I rate it 8.5/10\",\n",

However, lately there were quite a few great ones, like \"I, Tonya\" or \"Darkest Hour\". And man, this movie is definitely one of those great ones.The most fascinating aspect for me is that the movie is thrilling, it puts you on the edge of your sit for the entirety of it, the racing scenes are incredible, and it was truly a pleasure watching it without knowing Ken Miles\\' storyline, I was surprise a bunch of times. That\\'s me though, I bet that most people would at least search a bit before watching the movie.Anyways, the movie has great cinematography, amazing performances by Damon and Bale. Also a shout out to Josh Lucas, he did great as well here, I hated him for most of the movie, and that was definitely the goal here.The score is good too. The movie is 2h30 hours long, but it never feels like it, you are so damn entertained by the thing, that when is ending you actually feel like you could watch another hour of it in a heartbeat.To sum up, James Mangold once again does a great job in his new movie, and he definitely has my attention now. Ford v Ferrari is a great movie for movie lovers but also for the casual moviegoer, who can simply watch for the sake of watching the racing sequences, at the end of the day, no one will be disappointed.',\n",

Unable to take this lightly and vowing revenge, Ford II decides to use his considerable resources to defeat Ferrari in the 1966 Le Mans race.

When I first saw the trailer for this film, I knew I had to see it. Sometimes, when you watch a preview, you can tell that you\\'ve just seen all the best parts of the movie. Not so with this one. It delivers.The biopic starts with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) receiving the bad news that he can no longer race since it would put too much strain on his heart and steer him to an early grave. So, he pairs up with race car driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and together they form a friendship while remaining on the racing circuit and designing cars. When Ford Motors sales begin to plummet, Henry Ford II turns to Lee Iacocca for advice. Iacocca recommends that they purchase the now bankrupt Ferarri company. This plan is turned down by Enzo Ferarri who agrees to sell to Fiat instead. Enter Shelby and Miles as they team up with Ford to design a car that will put Ford back on the map by winning the famed Le Manz, a 24-hour endurance race.I absolutely love this movie. It really is why we go to the theaters. The production values were second to none, the cinematography engaging, the racing stunts eye popping, the acting believable and the story involving. The only reason it doesn\\'t get a full 10 stars from me is because it does run a little long.

So in this case, we\\'re asked to root for the Ford Motor Company with their obnoxious, win-at-all-costs boss, Henry Ford II (Tracie Letts), and his minions, who propose that Ford enter the racing game as a grand marketing promotion opportunity.\\nIn looking at the title of this film, one can get the wrong first impression that the antagonist is Ferrari, the small Italian car manufacturer, known for its output of luxury vehicles as well as success in sports car racing. After Henry Ford attempts to buy Ferrari and is turned down, this is his impetus for getting involved in the racing game. His goal is to develop a new, blazing fast car that can usurp Ferrari\\'s dominant position in winning one prestigious race after another (particularly on the French Le Mans circuit).\\nFerrari thus has little screen time after the initial rejection of the Ford buyout. Instead, Ford hires Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) a famous driver forced to retire due to a heart condition, now with an up and coming reputation as a top notch car designer. Shelby, an aggressive straight-shooter, hires the loose cannon Brit, Ken Miles, as his driver and mechanic consultant, just as he\\'s about to lose his auto body shop due to non-payment of taxes.\\nMeanwhile, Henry Ford appoints Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) as his Senior Vice President in charge of developing the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype, the super car that\\'s ultimately supposed to best Ferrari at Le Mans. Bebbe, a buffoon of a character, becomes the antagonist, when he opposes Shelby and his insistence that Miles take the wheel during the big race. Bebbe can\\'t stomach such a \"politically incorrect\" character as Miles and insists that other drivers test out the new Ford car at the upcoming Le Mans race. Sure enough, Ford ends up losing badly against Ferrari.\\nA cursory glance of the true history of all these machinations reveals that Beebe\\'s push back against Shelby was exaggerated: the main sticking point in the film is his insistence that Davis not be the appointed driver. Historically, that never happened: the year before success, Davis actually DID race at Le Mans and lost to Ferrari.\\nThere\\'s more standard Hollywood treatment here with the specious suggestion that the development of the GT40 Mk 1 was mainly due to Davis\\'s innate knowledge of car mechanics-there\\'s a scene where Shelby rejects a computer analysis by Ford engineers and trusts Davis, with his more home-grown approach, to fine tune the car. In actuality, the Ford engineers worked in close conjunction with Shelby and Davis, and the ultimate success was truly a team effort.\\nWhile Damon\\'s part as Shelby in the first half of the film revolves around defending Miles and convincing Ford that Beebe\\'s approach at micro-managing will not work, in the second half, his role is really reduced to a glorified cheerleader, as Christian Bale ends up with the much juicier part of actually driving the car during the Daytona 500 \"tune-up\" and the ultimate challenge at Le Mans.\\nAll the behind-the-scenes drama ends up as a kind of mixed bag. Shelby trying to rein in the aforementioned \"loose cannon\" Miles can be entertaining but sometimes gets a bit much (especially when Damon and Bale fight like five year olds, tussling on the ground while Miles\\' wife looks on). Speaking of Miles\\' wife, Mollie (played by the sultry British actress Caitriona Balfe), she and their young son Peter, have little to do throughout, also often acting as glorified cheerleaders.\\nThe aforementioned behind-the-scenes drama also applies to the goings-on at the Ford Motor Company. There\\'s a good scene where Shelby takes Henry Ford for a test drive which causes him to have an epiphany regarding the danger of driving these type of cars. As a result, Ford entrusts Shelby with calling the shots after the initial loss to Ferrari at Le Mans.\\nLess successful is the way the scenarists handle Beebe who is reduced to the aforementioned buffoon. I\\'m thinking especially of that ridiculous scene where Shelby locks Beebe in an office, preventing him from giving orders during one of the critical test races.\\nUltimately, a film such as this needs to present a credible and entertaining enough behind-the-scenes drama in addition to its actual racing sequences. On that score, I will reiterate, the Ford v Ferrari \"drama\" is passable, which will hold your interest (not all of it is that \"believable\" however, on the other hand).\\nThe racing scenes (particularly the ones at Le Mans) are particularly well done and the outcome is a bit of a curve ball (SPOILERS: with Ferrari out of the race, Miles, who is way ahead, is ordered to slow down so that all three Ford cars cross the finish line at the same time!).\\nThe film also manages some pathos at the climax, when Miles ends up being killed in a test drive accident two months after his triumph at Le Mans. Racing aficionados will probably dig this wholeheartedly. Much lesser enthusiasts (such as myself) can appreciate the screenwriting effort, despite the Hollywood treatment.',\n",

With their limitless budget it took a few years for them to finally succeed at beating the tiny Ferrari company at Le Mans.

Yes, this movie might be 20mins to long, but it takes you on a long and exciting ride with an end you won't see coming, unless you spoil yourself with how the race in '66 ended - my advice: DON'T! it will pay off.I'm a Formula 1 enthusiast and occasionally watch the Le Mans races as well, so I wasn't aware how the race in '66 ended. I wasn't even aware of the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then, but this movie won't bore you with the details to much. It gives the necessary overview of the needed context, so that every viewer understands what's on the line here.I'd recommend a viewing in an IMAX for sure, to feel the sound and experience the race for yourself. Much like Rush, this movie manages to get the excitement of racing transformed to the audience, without focussing on any crashes or the (back then) still live threatening motorsport.\",\n",
       " \"The (mostly) true story of two passionate gear-heads and their tireless quest to unseat mighty Team Ferrari at the grueling 24-hour Le Mans endurance race. Armed, that is, with the financial backing (and all-too frequent corporate meddling) of Ford Motor Company. In that sense, it's a war on two fronts: they're playing catch-up against a more advanced opponent while also fending off the various obstacles and bad ideas tossed down from their own corporate brass.Christian Bale and Matt Damon, somehow sharing the screen for the first time, provide all the personality this flick needs to maintain momentum, while the hair-raising cockpit scenes nail the hairpin turns. Bale plays the more fiery of the pair; a sparky, cocksure driver who comes out of near-retirement for this chance at immortality. Damon's man is full of piss and vinegar, too, but more amicable to the kind of machinations necessary for navigating a corporate American boardroom. From the first word, they're great together. It's not an easy relationship to define - blows are exchanged, often comically, more than once - but there's no arguing their kinship, even if both might brush it off as a mere working association. They both know the fine points of their job, and the slight quirks and deviations that make them essential to one another.Several of the film's plot twists are telegraphed, even for those (like I) who didn't know the full story coming in, and it's guilty of occasionally dipping into the well of over-worn sports movie tropes, but otherwise it's an effective pulse-pounder.\",\n",

I initially took an interest in the movie when I saw it stared (Matt Damon) and (Christian Bale) I went into this movie on a complete whim that it might be worth watching. Admittedly I was a little lost during the first thirty minutes of the movie but after getting familiar with the characters aswell as the cars I easily settled into the movies storyline and awesome looking fast paced driving.I didn\\'t expect this movie to explain how race cars are built or explain anything on a technical level. I was honestly hoping this movie would give a little history on Le Mans and showcase the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari with some fast paced driving scene\\'s that get the adrenaline pumping. Le Mans \\'66 delivered everything I expected and more not only do we get some beautifully shot driving scenes that look amazing we also get a real heartfelt story of two men who put their heart and soul into making a beautiful car capable of winning Le Mans and all for a company that showed them little to no respect but they still continued to do what they loved building and racing uniquely built cars with a purpose.The performances from lead actors (Matt Damon) and (Christian Bale) are Oscar worthy the passion they put into their unique performances is arguably some of their best work on screen in years. The supporting cast also do a great job of bringing the movie to life every actor and actress is a perfect fit for their role in the movie both the big roles and the smalls roles are perfectly cast.The one and only complaint I have about this movie is Christian Bales absolutely awful \"British\" accent that he has throughout the entire movie I think he was going for a classic Cockney accent but instead he sounds like an American trying to imitate a 18th century London chimney sweep. Other than that Bales performance is brilliant.I recommend giving this movie a chance even if you have no interest in cars and racing there\\'s still plenty to enjoy and plenty you can learn from it\\'s story I certainly felt like I knew more about racing and Le Mans than I did before going into the movie.',\n",

       " \"Ford v Ferrari is a well-made, well-shot film with some very good acting. It is also an utterly boring, predictable, by-the-numbers sports/competition success story, and that is its damning flaw. The plot contains almost conceivable cliche that can be found in this sort of movie, hitting all the usual story beats. A hastily-assembled crew of outcasts being given a seemingly impossible task against an unbeatable sports rival, dealing with their personal problems and struggling against the interference of smug, suited corporate figures who do not like the fact that our heroes are not types who play by the book, and growing as characters along the way. Directing-wise, this plot comes with all the usual accoutrements, the most obvious of which is montages where the team of underdogs progress in their quest.The result is a movie where one can easily guess all the plot points and how the next scene is going to play out. Even the lighthearted, comedic moments happen exactly the way such scenes happen in every other movie of this kind. All of this especially becomes a problem when it is far longer than it should be. And despite the bloated runtime, some story elements somehow remain underwhelming. We know that the main characters are good friends simply because the script pretty much tells us so, but this is not properly set up. Some of the context and the events that drive the story forward are difficult to figure out, although this may be less so for viewers who are familiar with the racing context and the real-life events. In addition, it is sad that for a movie titled Ford v Ferrari, we never really see the events from the Italians' side, who remain bumbling foes beset by their overconfidence throughout the film.All of this is not the say that the movie is not well-made. It is, despite the obvious CGI-y look of some of the racing scenes, and this is pretty much the reason behind my 6/10 score. If you are a diehard racing fan, or -for whatever reason- have never seen a sports/competition movie of this kind, you might really like it. Otherwise, the redeeming qualities of the picture are not enough to save it from being pretty much a total bore.\",\n",
       " 'I read a review of this film in the New Yorker that said the title was unfortunate because it would make people think it was a sports film when it was more than that. The reviewer was wrong. This is a sports movie, with all the sports movie tropes, and it\\'s all been done better.The film follows car designers Carrol Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles as they work to help Ford create a car that can beat Ferrari\\'s in a big race. This in itself is odd, in that the movie wants you to see the guys working for a corporate behemoth as scrappy underdogs, which is a bit of a stretch.This is very much a boy movie, by which I mean it\\'s entirely focused on testosterone-fueled competition ranging from international pissing contests to corporate competition to fist fights on the lawn. You could easily call this movie \"Mine is Bigger.\" And much of my problem with the movie was I didn\\'t care whose was bigger.The best thing in the movie is Bale as Miles. Instead of the typical cocky race driver of other films, Miles comes across as grease-monkey engineer who not only engineers the car but also plans and engineers his entire race. It\\'s a smart, amiable performance that should be in a better movie.I am perplexed that this movie was nominated for an Oscar against genuinely significant movies like Parasite and Jojo Rabbit. The best I can say of it is that it is less undeserving of the nomination than Joker. I\\'m also puzzled by all the gushing reviews.There are some good moments, particularly in the racing scenes, but the film is hugely overlong and everything past the end of the race feels like a needless and maudlin dragging out of something that should have been a zippy 90-minute film.Not recommended.',\n",

Carroll Shelby, the most beloved car designer in American history, faces the music when it comes to dealing with the Big Boys. His desire for endurance race success coincides with Ford's corporate decision to get racier, inspired by Lee Iacocco (the father of the Mustang). After that it's all individualism vs. corporate bullxxxx. I think Damon is the most reliable star out there, and it's a stretch but not too much of a stretch for him to play country outlaw Shelby. Bale is also stretch but a workable stretch for the equally individualistic Miles, a Brit racer and car designer. Henry Ford II is also magnificently played. The CGI was under control, the movie ran long but not unpleasantly so, the wrap up was a tad awkward but that happens. Appears to have captured the basic facts and feelings of the true life events, for which it deserves kudos. Could be enjoyed by non-racing fans.\",\n",

This movie manages to get the audience feel the excitement and thrill of racing. A strong screenplay with phenomenal performance by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, not to mention other supporting actors like Noah Jupe and Josh Lucas. The chemistry between Bale and Damon is engaging, their characters fit so well.Solid movie from start to finish, I'd really recommend you to watch it with IMAX. One of the best movies for this year.

Similar to First Man they hope no one will notice the misfire. Plus too many scenes of life lessons and a trademark killjoy biopic wife extend this half an hour too long...how many times can they bring out the exact same scene of Josh Lucas being a jerk or the wife being movie-wifey? But that is a great Christian Bale performance. He knows exactly how to register and where to pinpoint every beat. He's like the ultimate older brother.

Christian Bale was just phenomenal. Especially if you consider that just last year at the same time he was playing a totally different character in \"Vice\", physically and also Motivation wise. Here he gives us an ordinary man with exatraordinary abilities and quite a tough mindset. He is great and once again proves he is one of hte most verstaile actors out there. Matt Damon was also good but definitely stayed in the shadow of Bale. Also because I think the characters were much more intersted in developing Ken than Carroll. And this is one of the very few flaws of the film. Another worth-to-mention perfomance came from Tracey Letts. and on a lesser extend Jon Bernthal.\\nJames Mangold understood perfectly to Combine strong characters in a very solid Story with many great technical aspects to make one of a Kind of Hollywood film I dearly miss.

Imagine a roller coaster simulated in a movie theater. The seats also let you feel the rumble of the car engines and lights in the auditorium add the finishing touches such as sparks.Ford v Ferrari is a movie about the Le Mans, France 24 hour race that pitted the Ford Motor company vs. the all-time winner Ferrari. More than that, it is about the friendship between American car engineer Carroll Shelby and the unsung hero English car racer Ken Miles.Have you ever wanted to experience what it's like to be in the pilot's seat of a race car?

       " \"James Mangold is a great director and has given us amazing films like Walk the Line and his last film Logan which has impressed us immensely. His newest film, Ford v Ferrari, is another entertaining and well made film that adds to Mangold's filmography.Ford v Ferrari tells the story of car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles who build a race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 hour race known as Le Mans in 1966.This movie is one of the best of the year which audiences and car enthusiasts will enjoy throughout. You can tell how much care and effort was put into this project once you watch the film. The racing sequences were really well shot and a blast to witness. None of it felt fake or seemed like a CGI fest because of how practical everything seemed. It must have been really difficult to film those scenes but the crew pulled it off beautifully. The overall look of the movie was gorgeous. It really captured the essence of the time period this film is set in which contributed to the authenticity of everything shown.The acting from everyone was amazing. Matt Damon gives a solid performance and his partner in crime, Christian Bale, also provides the same result. Both stars have great chemistry with each other and are a joy to see. Jon Bernthal was also great as well as the rest of the supporting cast.The film clocks in at 2 hours and 30 minutes but it didn't feel like that all. The first half did drag a little bit as it mainly consisted of business meetings and proposals but it doesn't affect the pacing much. Once the racing starts, the time flies. James Mangold does an excellent job directing especially during the racing scenes which flowed well and was easy to watch. He adds a level of intensity to them through the visuals rather than using loud music or crazy slo-mo which I admire. The screenplay had great moments of character and a surprising amount of funny dialogues. Not once did it feel boring.I have to admit I wasn't expecting Ford v Ferrari to be THIS good! The characters were engaging, the acting was spot on, the races felt intense and the aesthetics were great. If this film were to be nominated at the Oscars, I wouldn't mind.

Pretty standard stuff really. Bale's UK Midlands accent is pretty poor but just about better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney chimney sweep! Given that he is English it should be better - but he nevertheless presents a likeable character. Damon presents no surprises as the ultimate straight man - but he always does this well. It could have finished nicely without showing Miles' demise - a footnote would have respectfully sufficed. But other than this I'm struggling to really fault the film. Naturally it does gloss over certain aspects of the real story and outside of the USA no one refers to the race as the 24 hours 'OF' Le Mans - but does it really matter and does it detract from the overall story? No of course not. This is exactly what it says on the tin. No more and no less. I refer to my title.😀\",\n",

       " 'Ford v Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen.\\nBefore his back-to-back dips into the comic-book universes of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the X-Men - in the films Logan and The Wolverine - James Mangold nimbly danced through genres in search of compelling characters. He\\'d make a Tom Cruise actioner like Knight & Day, but add on a bumbling innocent character to spice up the routine spy genre. He\\'d plunge into a conventional biopic like Walk the Line, but reinvent it with the aide of two commanding performance at the head of his Johnny Cash story.\\nMangold\\'s back at the helm of a sturdy, red-blooded American story of ingenuity and stick-to-your-guns re-invention for the spectacular new Ford v Ferrari. You\\'ve probably seen this type of story told before, but rarely this well, with supreme talents overcoming nearly impossible odds to achieve a goal everyone tells them they can\\'t get.\\nIt\\'s the late 1960s, and Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) faces a serious issue. The Ford brand, time-tested and baked into the American popular culture, is struggling to contend against an onslaught of cooler, hipper cars. Kids coming back from the war hardly want to plunk down cash on the cars on which their dads used to depend. Ford needs bold, company-saving ideas, and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) has one.\\nIacocca wants Ford to compete on the global racing circuit. Specifically, Iacocca wants Ford to go head-to-head with the dominant force of the international circuit: Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). To do that, Ford recruits two men with intimate knowledge of this field: celebrated automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), who raced in and won the annual 24 Hours of LeMans in 1959; and Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hard-headed and short-tempered grease monkey who has a seamless connection to his automobiles, and might be the only person talented enough to drive the car Ford needs to build from scratch.\\nEven if you know the results of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans - and the outcome has been famous in the race world since the moment the event concluded - Mangold\\'s Ford v Ferrari captivates and entertains with the peaks and valleys of the team\\'s journey. The riveting drama spins a classic narrative of teamwork and ingenuity in the face of stifling adversity, as Shelby and Miles constantly had to convince Ford of the risks that needed to be taken if they actually wanted to win the race, and not just contend.\\nMangold recruits two of the greatest male actors working today to play his leads, but they are overshadowed by one intangible co-star I like to call \"speed.\" The racing scenes in Ford v Ferrari are breathtakingly innovative, with Mangold and his team routinely figuring out new ways to put us in the driver\\'s seat of some of the fastest vehicles on the planet. The chief obstacle facing Shelby and Miles was making their protoptype race car faster, so the tests performed in the film had to convey that achievement. Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen.\\nBale, in particular, is fantastic as the flawed and conceited Ken Miles, a dedicated husband and father who can\\'t help but put his passion for cars ahead of the family he loves. He\\'s conflicted by his desire to be around for them, but unable to resist the temptation that comes with the challenge of being right about the cars that Shelby fights to design. Arguably, Ford could not have competed at 24 Hours of Le Mans without Ken Miles\\' contributions, and I\\'d shudder to think of a version of Ford v Ferrari without Bale behind the wheel.\\nUnder Mangold\\'s watchful eye, Ford v Ferrari tells a stirring, inspirational story about professional pride, and tells it extremely well. The screenplay creates rich, complicated characters out of its underdog-sport template (though two supporting characters drag the main plot down with their unnecessary contributions), and Mangold\\'s precision for filmmaking helps the ride stay perpetually smooth and swift. Hollywood used to specialize in these audience-bonding crowd pleasers. Now they are few and far between, so when one speeds along and is firing on all cylinders, so out of your way to support it.',\n",

A film that has heart, passion for a craft, strong performers, dreams that become reality - a film worth watching on the big screen, that keeps you entertained for 150 minutes. Well, Ford v Ferrari is that film.American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world\\'s oldest active sports car race in endurance racing, in 1966.Shelby and Miles aren\\'t doing this for fame or the prize at the end of the finish line, they do it because they love racing, building something from scratch and making it even better than ever thought possible. That\\'s where the heart of this film lies. Just like those guys, you can tell director James Mangold and his team made this film with a passion for filmmaking. From production design, to camera movements in- and outside the race cars, to the attention to detail when it comes to costume design and historic accuracy. A true feat for Hollywood and for cinema goers worldwide.20th Century Fox/Disney does seem to want to attract an audience that\\'s interested in cars and racing, but this film is more than just that. It\\'s about business and family, the message this film tells without any hesitance is universal and will keep everyone intrigued for its entire two and a half hour runtime. There\\'s never a dull moment in this what might seem boring on paper event-film. Even the longest dialogues are riddled with Bale\\'s over-the-top face acting and writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller made sure to have serious conversations supercharged with dry humour. Bale proves how much of an acting-chameleon he is - I\\'ve never seen him do anything like this before. Even Damon, who I\\'m personally not the biggest fan of, since I find him very one-note, deserves my recognition as being simply incredible as Bale\\'s on screen \"co-driver\".The supporting cast might not be filled with household Hollywood names, but this cast is without a doubt one of the best ensembles you\\'ll see all year. Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place) and Caitriona Balfe (Outlander) as Miles\\' son and wife will have many viewers look up their names. Jupe has a joyful screen presence that makes you want to protect him at all costs, while Balfe stands her ground with her mesmerising charisma. Her chemistry with Bale feels so naturally intimate, as if they\\'re a married couple in real life - I found myself smiling every time they interacted with each other - magical! Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts and Remo Girone each give compelling performances in every scene they bump and run.Although I said this wasn\\'t just a movie about racing, it does have the most spectacular race sequences I\\'ve seen in years, thanks to Phedon Papamichael\\'s off the charts cinematography, flawless VFX and the amazing sound design team. Following the cars on ground level in hair clip turns is sweat inducing and will have you gasping for clean air when stuff completely goes wrong. There\\'s never a moment you won\\'t believe it\\'s not Bale himself who sits behind the wheel.Ford v Ferrari is the kind of movie everyone will enjoy. It has big Hollywood stars telling a timeless story about friendship and making dreams come true. In a year, full of sequels and remakes, what more do you want? This is one of the most entertaining films you\\'ll see this year.',\n",

Bale played a Brit loudmouth with a temper, his wife and kid played stereotypical posh Brits with a heart of gold and zero personality. They all came across as phony. Every character in this movie seemed like they were playing their modern day selves, just on a sixties set with sixties clothing.Matt Damon basically plays himself, almost like he walked off the Bourne set and put a cowboy hat on. Bam, that' was the extent of his attempt to play Carol Shelby. Total joke, I wouldn't have paid him a dollar to play this role.

It was all about Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles.Things about the movie were just weird. One character had a bubble jacket that I don't think would have been around back then. Matt Damon's character goes to meet Ken Miles' wife after a certain event, doesn't go speak to her...also, in spite of a tragic event recently happening, she and the kid act like nothing is wrong and life is great.

Le Mans \\'66 requires no prior interest in the sport in the same way that you don\\'t need to be a boxing fanatic to enjoy Rocky. At heart, it\\'s a character piece; a platonic romance between two men best able to express themselves behind the wheel. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon, affable as ever) is a former racerturned-car designer. In the \\'60s he\\'s hired by Ford to head up the ailing motor company\\'s morale-boosting effort to win the famous 24 Hours Of Le Mans endurance race. And, more specifically, to beat the reigning Ferrari team while doing so.\\nShelby brings in his buddy Ken Miles (Christian Bale) not only to help design the vehicle that Ford is betting the farm on, but also to drive it. The aptly named Miles is purely driven by his passion for the automotive arts and an unquenchable need for speed. Wayward Brummie accent aside, it\\'s a lovely, warm performance from Bale. There\\'s the trademark intensity - heightened by his geometrically sharp cheekbones - but here it\\'s in service to a common goal, and a love of the sport. Miles doesn\\'t suffer fools, but there\\'s a sweetness to his family-man side and the sheer thrill he gets from racing, hooting things like \"Giddy-up!\" as he pushes the rev counter to its limit. If Miles is the heart of the team, Shelby\\'s the head, bringing his own racing expertise to bear while also managing the expectations of the suits upstairs, including the irascible Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and smarmy marketing type Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). (There\\'s a barely hidden filmmaking analogy here, as the creative visionaries struggle to keep their ideas on track while placating the needs of the executives.) Throw in Jon Bernthal as another, more amenable, exec and the cast starts to feel a little bloated, especially given that the two-hours-30 runtime is generous for a film on a largely predictable track. Bernthal\\'s good, but did we really need another middle-man in the mix, given that Shelby already occupies that negotiator role?\\nLe Mans \\'66 truly roars into life during the racing scenes, particularly the final act show-stopper. The visceral, pulsequickening laps instantly join the canon of great race sequences, and they\\'re a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously \\'bankable\\' blockbusters. But Mangold\\'s film isn\\'t quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen that there\\'s never a palpable sense of a head-to-head rivalry. In their minimal screentime, the Italians come across as scowling stereotypes. And on the subject of stereotypes, Outlander\\'s Caitriona Balfe is lumbered with a limited supportive-wife role as Mollie Miles. It\\'s clear she knows her way around an engine, but she\\'s rarely required to do more that squint with concern at a radio while her husband races. The family scenes don\\'t quite get under the skin of Miles\\' compulsions in the way that First Man explored the more selfish aspects of Neil Armstrong\\'s pursuits. It\\'s on the physical side that Le Mans \\'66 really delivers - not only in the aforementioned races, but in the lo-fi mechanics, and the pit stops that canon of great race sequences, and they\\'re a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously \\'bankable\\' blockbusters.

For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen take an eternity in comparison to modern-day refuelling methods. The film is a visual treat, an expertly crafted piece of sun-burnished Americana, with no shortage of big-screen thrills. Mangold\\'s career to date has seen a mix of straightforward blockbusters (Knight And Day, The Wolverine) and character pieces (Girl, Interrupted, Cop Land, Walk The Line) but, for all its strengths, Le Mans \\'66 doesn\\'t straddle that divide as effectively as Mangold\\'s last film, Logan, did.',\n",

To do this they are going to knock Ferrari off their perch and win the Le Mans 24 hours race.Of course it is odd to see Ford, a corporate Goliath to be cast as the underdog here.

In retaliation Ford develop a racing car at a super speed with Miles testing it.Ford v Ferrari is an enjoyable if overlong melodrama, the Le Mans race scenes are done very well.

       " \"From a production standpoint: this film is bloody brilliant. Expert craftsmanship all around from the photography, editing, acting. I imagine this was a very difficult film to make and was handled with expertise.The screenplay was very disappointing, however.The racing scenes are fantastic, but most of the non-racing scenes are just cookie-cutter and uninspired. If the racing scenes weren't so thrilling and engaging, this movie wouldn't have a leg to stand on. There are certain themes and elements which James Mangold does so well-and you can expect to see them in this film-but they're never really explored with much depth. Themes such as fatherhood, sacrifice, independence in spite of authority, what a man must do to take care of his family, a child's expectations of their father; all of these are just lifeless, dead on arrival.There's one female character in the film and she gets to sit at home and be the supportive wife to Christian Bale's character. That said, this is one of Christian Bale's best performances. He steals every scene he's in-but, unfortunately he only is ever given the same 3 beats to play. How many times can you watch him get angry when someone tells him he can't do something? Entertaining as it may be, it grows stale after a while.The two-and-a-half-hour run time feels like three. Fantastic editing not withstanding, at least thirty minutes of the film could have cut. Cut this film down by thirty minutes, and you have a serious Oscar contender. Keep it the way it is, and you have a real letdown of what could have been one of the year's best.\",\n",

Christian Bale was absolutely outstanding, and even though he had done this before, the body transformation from portraying Dick Chaney to Ken Miles still just makes me want to stand up and clap my hands. His determination and commitment to the role is on another level, not achievable to most actors out there. I've read that the main reason Damon wanted to do this movie, was to be able to work with Bale. Seemed like they two knew each other for years and have done dozens of movies together. The fight scene was hilarious!As somebody who didn't know the story at all or have had any interest in Le Mans, the racing footage was excellent and well presented. It really makes you sad when Ken was cheated out of winning it but you can see he didn't care. He wasn't in it for fame.Go and see it on the big screen while you can.

I don\\'t have to be \"into\" a subject in order to enjoy a movie about it, if the movie is done well.\"Ford v Ferrari\" is the kind of dull, bland movie made to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, which....guess what?.....it was. The world is full of urgent problems, so what\\'s the last thing we need? A bro movie about a car race from 50 years ago. But if you\\'re going to make one, try to make one more memorable than this. This is the kind of movie that makes whenever it\\'s set look like a glossy magazine version of that particular time period. It\\'s the kind of movie that has one woman in it, in this case The Wife, who the screenplay assures us belongs in this world of boring white men because she knows a lot about cars and can be sexually suggestive when talking about them. It\\'s the kind of movie that lets us know who the chief rival in the big final race is by cutting to shots of him glowering at the screen literally every 15 seconds. It\\'s full of a certain American attitude I simply can\\'t stand, exemplified by the fact that it has to make all of the Europeans in the movie look like bungling fools. I\\'m not sure what the movie\\'s point is. I think it means to set up a conflict between those men who built and raced cars because of their passion for the art of it and those who just wanted to make a buck off of it. So of course this message is packaged in the safest, shiniest, most corporate Hollywood product imaginable.Matt Damon\\'s good ol\\' boy accent is unacceptable. Christian Bale is too good to be in this movie. Noah Jupe is a cute kid but he\\'s used as a cheap narrative tactic to make us even more worried about the race scenes because we don\\'t want to have to watch a little boy watch his dad go up in flames in real time.

I thought the way the story was told was really straight forward and lacked any depth. I would have liked to see more of Ferrari's perspective, I thought Ken Miles family dialogue didn't feel very important to the story, I thought, outside of Tracy Letts, the supporting cast fell way short.So, while it was an easy watch despite its 2.5 hour run time, it lacked depth to bring it from a fun movie to a great movie.\",\n",

The worst flaw is in the way they filmed the circuit De La Sarthe: first, there\\'s no iconic shot on the Mulsanne straight, that\\'s something I don\\'t understand; secondly, they failed in showing what a grind was driving at 300kmh for three minutes, with a couple of very hard brakes.

       " 'Greetings again from the darkness. 7000 RPM. Racing legend Carroll Shelby describes that as the moment of racing bliss in the opening of the film. We are reminded of early test pilots breaking the sound barrier, or explorers reaching the peak of Mt. Everest. What follows is two-and-a-half hours of history, rivalries, egos, and sport. The racing scenes are exhilarating, and the men are driven by testosterone and compelled to be the best. They are throwbacks to a different era. An era that wasn\\'t about fairness and feelings, but of determination and focus that produced results - either success or failure. There were winners and losers, and the ceremonies awarded no participation ribbons.Who are these men? They are Carroll Shelby, Ken Miles, Henry Ford II, and Enzo Ferrari. Director James Mangold (LOGAN, WALK THE LINE) takes the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans and turns it into a rivalry between car makers, a friendship between racing icons, a look at corporate buffoonery that still exists today, and an old-fashioned movie that is fun to watch ... regardless of whether you know the first thing about racing or cars.Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the war veteran race driver-turned-designer hired to push Ford racing into world class status. Shelby is an industry icon who won the 1959 Le Mans before retiring due to a heart condition. He then founded and ran Shelby-American for designing and improving cars. He wore cowboy hats that were only eclipsed in size by his bravura in most situations. Christian Bale plays legendary driver Ken Miles, another war veteran and bombastic friend of Shelby, who can best be described as a race car savant. Contrary to the film\\'s title, the story belongs to these two men, and the film belongs to these two actors.Co-writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller take some liberties with the script and bend a few historical details to make the parts fit a Hollywood production ... but for the most part, the story is pretty accurate. Just a few years after the Edsel fiasco, Henry Ford II is agitated at the state of Ford Motor Company, and after a bitter and personally insulting failed buyout of Ferrari, Mr. Ford (played with proper arrogance by Tracy Letts) decides to engage in motor-measuring with the Italian company run by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). He hires Shelby to elevate Ford racing to elite status with one main goal - beating Ferrari at Le Mans. Shelby\\'s cocksure approach manages to keep Miles onboard despite the internal battles with Ford executives, especially Leo Beebe (a smarmy Josh Lucas). Beebe doesn\\'t see Miles as \"a Ford man\", and in what is all too common in corporate life, prefers style over substance.The film could have easily been titled Corporate vs Cars. Although the Henry Ford vs Enzo Ferrari segment is quite entertaining, most of the time is spent with Shelby and Miles trying to reach their dream while negotiating corporate obstacles. These two men have a love for racing and each other - in an old school, manly-respect kind of way. They are simpatico in their quest for the perfect car, and as Miles explains to his son (Noah Jupe) in a terrific scene, the perfect lap.Additional supporting roles include Jon Bernthal as young visionary Lee Iacocca (who died earlier this year), Caitriona Balfe as Miles\\' supportive wife, and Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, the lead engineer on Shelby\\'s team. Of course, Iacocca went on to become Chairman of Chrysler, where he brought in Shelby to consult on the Dodge Viper, among other models. Supposedly Le Mans racing legend and 6-time winner Jackie Ickx appears in a crowd shot, but I missed it.There is a stark contrast between the Ferrari factory and the Ford assembly line, but the egos at the top are remarkably similar. A bruised ego lit the fuse for the rivalry, but it was the car guys who made it happen. The racing scenes are adrenaline-packed and the sound in the theatre, combined with Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (SIDEWAYS, NEBRASKA) close-ups inside the car, allow us to feel the rumble and vibration and speed sensation inside the Ford GT40. Damon and Bale are terrific. Damon struts with Shelby\\'s confidence, and Bale (after a huge weight loss from his role as Dick Cheney in VICE) captures the cantankerous genius of Miles - plus seeing his yell at other drivers during races is hilarious. There is a comical rumble between Miles and Shelby that will remind no one of Batman and Jason Bourne, but as difficult as it is to make popping a clutch exciting on the big screen, Mangold\\'s team comes through.',\n",

The core performances from Bale as Ken Miles and Damon as Carroll Shelby really sold the film to me as a couple of die hard car fanatics with a complicated friendship put together beautifully by James Mangold in the big chair.

I wasn't sure about Bale's accent as it veers a little too close to caricature for me, but he does win you over with his exuberance and charisma here so it's all okay.

Most of the drivers spend their time looking sideways at cars alongside them rather than at the track. They also watch a strange instrument that appears to show the speed in mph! Really!!! When did anyone put a speedometer into a racing car? It doesn't tell you anything and it would distract the driver.\\nThe Ferrari drivers are not given any dialogue so they make up for it with evil smirks taken from a 1920's horror film. The Ford drivers are even less lucky - you don't see them at all! Not even Denny Hulme who shared Miles's car.\\nThe racing at Le Mans was probably the most boring part of this over-long soap opera.\\nSomeone should have decided whether this is a sports docu-drama or a film exploring the relationships between the key players ...

I do remember that if you had either the Ford GT40 or a Ferrari card, there was a very good chance of winning the hand, unless, of course, the two cars came up against each other. Then you had to choose wisely.In the mid-'60s, Ford and Ferrari fought it out for real at Le Mans, a road race that lasts almost as long as this film (jk). At a whopping 152 minutes, director James Mangold's biopic is no quick win, but buckle up and sit back for the duration and you will be rewarded with a film that delivers great performances, a gripping tale of determination and courage, and some truly spectacular racing scenes (real or CGI? I couldn't tell).Matt Damon plays car designer Carroll Shelby (the man who gave us the AC Cobra, another good Top Trumps card) who is hired by Ford Motors to help build a car that can beat Ferrari at Le Mans, thereby improving the company's image in the eyes of young Americans and putting the Italians in their place at the same time. Christian Bale is Ken Mills, the man chosen by Shelby to drive the car against the wishes of Ford executive Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).A classic underdog story, the film follows the team as they design and test the new race-car, experiencing various setbacks along the way (some of which are orchestrated by Beebe, who wants to see Mills fail), before finally making it to France. American viewers will no doubt feel a sense of pride at Ford's remarkable endeavour, but it'll be us Brits who'll be cheering the loudest (at least on the inside), for it is Englishman Ken Miles (a likeable turn from Christian Bale) who is the real hero of the film, pushing himself and the car to the limits.The legendary 24-hour road race itself delivers all the thrills and spills necessary for an edge-of-the-seat finale, with Mills making a mockery of the Ferrari team as promised, but anyone geared up for a feel-good finish will be sorely disappointed, reality rarely being the fairytale we would like it to be. Remaining true to the facts, the film's final lap delivers a double-whammy of a downer that drives home the fact that, sometimes, life just sucks.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the hilarious scene in which Shelby takes Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) for a quick spin (and I do mean quick!).\",\n",

With a run time of 2 hours and 32 minutes, the film seemed interminable due to the long, padded scenes stuffed between the race car sequences.The main problem with the film was in the character developments, which were one-dimensional and lifeless. A chorus of executives at the Ford Motor Company were an indistinguishable set of cookie-cutters. Incredibly, the visionary Lee Iococca blended in with the others, and it was never explained to viewers the genius of Iococca in the development of one of Ford\\'s all-time best products, the Mustang. The one-note authoritarian dimension of Henry Ford II wore thin after his first scene, where he berates assembly line works and dismisses them for the day.The two principal race car drivers were also a sorry lot. Matt Damon dials in his performance of Carroll Shelby, a washed-up driver with a bum sticker, who is the liaison between the Ford executives and the world of the speedway. Christian Bale plays the role of driver Ken Miles as a down-on-his-luck schlub with an attitude. The maudlin scenes between Miles and his kid were a pathetic showcase of parenting, wherein the values taught to the little boy are that being a reckless hothead in life somehow pays off.The sappy dialogue of Miles and his long-suffering wife and the smarmy banter of the Ford executives bog the film down.

Still, the driving sequences are nice (not done with CGI) and the actors try their best....although the script occasionally (or more than occasionally) plays fast and loose with a few of the facts. Overall, very watchable but not a great history lesson and a film where you KNOW that the GT will eventually prove better than the Ferrari...otherwise, what would be the point of this film?!',\n",

Boy was I wrong.I don't like to give movies 10/10, (I've probably only done it once or twice in my life), but it took me several minutes to critique this movie enough to bring it down one star. My only critique is that it is a long movie. It's appx 3 hours long and you can feel it by the end.That being said, this is, in my opinion, the best movie of the year. Bale brought an Oscar winning performance as Ken Miles, a hardened, entertaining race car driver. His performance was probably one of the best of his careers. That was backed up by Damon, who played Carroll Shelby, a race car manufacturer with a love of racing. I only say that he backed up Bale because of how impressive Bale was, but if Damon had been alone in this movie, he would have easily been the star.The filming and editing was phenomenal. Sound was fantastic. The supporting cast were also great. All around, it was the most entertaining and the most inspiring movie of the year.\",\n",

       " \"The Ford vs. Ferrari story is amazingly accurate for a Hollywood made movie. Like many others, I ran to Wikipedia to look up Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby. Miles was a great car racer but not well known outside of car racing circles.The movie lovingly recreates that era and throws in a first rate cast headlined by Damon and Bales, but the rest of the characters ring true. The race car scenes which grab you by the throat are realistic as hell and heart pounding. The scenes showing the introduction of the new Ford Mustang, I remember very well. There were huge crowds at the Ford dealers and the demand for the cars was tremendous. Car racing back in the 1960's was a deadly dangerous sport with very few of the safety features incorporated in today's race cars. The Ford GT 40 really was fast and could hit 220 mph on the straightaways which is what today's Indy cars do, just for comparison. Matt Damon does a great job as Carroll Shelby, but minimizes the way Shelby cut corners in how he sold his cars, and he was slapped on the wrist a few times for his car selling practices. This is one of the few movies today that I would actually buy. It is such a great story and just listening to the sounds those cars made is worth the price. There isn't much not to like in this movie and it is a good antidote to the real world we are living in today if only for a few hours. I loved this movie.\",\n",

       " \"Ford versus Ferrari is too bland of a title for this amazing movie. International title Le Mans 66 already sounds much better. I would however propose Miles & Shelby: Friendship Through Racing. This is what the movie is all about. There is a lot of competition, culture, drama, hardship and racing in this film but once you have gotten the bigger picture, this movie really is about the friendship between an ambitious constructor and a tough driver.This gem of a movie convinces on numerous levels. The settings are authentic and bring the United States of America, Italy and France of the mid-sixties back to life. An old sports car here, an iconic poster there and legendary race circuits bring back the pioneer age of race driving.The actresses and actors are doing an outstanding job. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are two of the greatest actors to be around and they underline their excellent reputation for two and a half entertaining hours. Christian Bale convinces as rough guy with a tender core who cares as much about his own success as he does about his son who idolizes him. Matt Damon incarnates an ambitious entrepreneur who always strives to make the impossible possible. The supporting actors and actresses are also noteworthy as Caitriona Balfe convinces as resilient, smart and emotional wife and mother while Remo Girone delivers the goods by incarnating legendary entrepreneur Enzo Ferrari.The story is obviously also addictive as viewers care about the fates of the charismatic protagonists. The plot might be predictable, especially if you have some background knowledge about the actual events this movie is based upon. This however doesn't reduce this film's enjoyment because everything is crafted with authenticity, detail and wit.In the end, anyone who likes racing must watch this intense drama despite a few minor lengths. Those who were longing for a similar movie after the astonishing Rush six years earlier, will finally get something to crave for. Ford versus Ferrari is one of the most emotional dramas of the year and best enjoyed on the big screen at your local movie theatre.\",\n",

       " 'This is made by the filmmaker who previously did a lot to inspire Walk Hard, so it may be redundant to say that this biopic about the Men Who Raced Hard in the 60s has conventional moving parts and mechanisms in its plot and certain (ok most) characters.Aside from an ending that isn\\'t a surprise or shock given how clearly (or blatantly) it\\'s set up in the three-point Set-up/Reminder/Pay-off style in conventional screenwriting, this even has the kid who is there so that some of the grown-ups can explain things involving making some of the turns and, oh, being set on fire and surviving (not to say that this guy Ken Miles didn\\'t have a son I\\'m sure he did that\\'s not what I\\'m saying I\\'m talking about the TEXT of the story for pete\\'s sake). Id even say Josh Lucas is only here because the writers think the stakes of a 24 hour race aren\\'t enough so one needs the Corporate Suit Who Is Against Our Rebel Batman-Driver (and not to say there weren\\'t pencil-pushing hacks at Ford then, I wasn\\'t there and neither were you, but it\\'s a total cliche thru and thru).....YET, There\\'s two things. First, to make a car analogy again because it\\'s fitting, Ford v Ferrari works and moves like a dependable and well-oiled machine and which, not to get off on a long tangent because who the hell has time, would probably please journalists nowadays looking for \"Pizzazz\" with otherwise enthralling events (sorry if you know what Im referring to and I digress on current events), it also has star-actors who get to find subtleties within the little beats of the script and/or where Manhole finds a moment to let it breathe (a pivotal character beat between Ken and Mollie where she speeds like hell to get the bloody truth out of his man ends up being one, and so in the very last scene with Shelby and the kid), fantastic cinematography and editing and a score/song selections that rock immensely, and Tracy Letts (writer of Bug and Killer Joe) hilariously crying like a baby at another key scene in a fast car.Second, the climax threw me for a loop in a way that made me very pleased - especially, as odd timing and weird I won\\'t say luck but happenstance would have it, as this is a former Fox movie but now \"owned\" by Disney - because it speaks to a strong, hard lesson about what can happen in following the Corporate Line. Ken could go one way and be the independent rock star hero he is to himself and his son and a few others, or follow what he\\'s been told will look good for a photo. His decision at first seems like and is deceptively a \"Good\" beat, where it\\'s almost like the movie is saying, \"yeah, sometimes you gotta suck it up and do what they tell you.\" But the actual consequence of this turns it on its head, and while the film doesn\\'t hold on it for too long, it still resonates in a world where so many people are told to do something a particular way, and it opens one up to get... Screwed.I don\\'t know if I read into it too much or the way the filmmakers intended, but it puts an excellent bow on the underlying subtext (or flat out text, your pick) about how to get ahead or not get ahead or simply the pitfalls in a world dominated by corporate interests.Oh, and it\\'s a helluva adaptation of Speed Racer and/or Mario Kart, you decide there.',\n",

Couple that with a film that appeared to stay faithful to racing\\'s core principles and sparsely use CGI for stunts, I was then invested in seeing where this depiction of Le Mans \\'66 would end up going. My doubts, regretfully, were reinforced roughly halfway through the film: the plot had devolved, the characters inconsequential, and the on-screen action boiled down to a clunky contest between the \"God-driven, hard-working\" Ford company and their lazily-stereotyped adversaries at Ferrari.Carroll Shelby (Damon), an ex-racer now mechanic/expert on the national circuit is recruited by Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) to begin work on a racing outfit under the name of Ford. Interestingly, Bernthal (a highly regarded actor in his own right) was painted in the trailers as a key figure in this film - however, he is marginalised almost instantly, making the final product appear recut since shooting finished. Shelby recommends the British driver Ken Miles (Bale), a notoriously difficult but brilliant driver to race under Ford at Le Mans. However, a comically minor incident between Miles and Chief Exec Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) begins the most out-of-proportion grudge between the two, constantly trying to screw the company over for absolutely no founded reason other than they rubbed the wrong way.This is the plot for the next 2 hours, interspersed with ugly stereotypes of either the English (through Miles and his family) or the Italians (portrayed as evil, scheming foreigners working under Enzo Ferrari\\'s orders). This further ruins the realism of the entire film - am I really supposed to believe that the conglomerate that is Ford Motors is really the altruist in a story about the authenticity of racing? Further to this - isn\\'t it beyond indolent to completely omit Miles\\' driving partners (Bruce McLaren and Denny Hulme) in a film about a race requiring two drivers throughout? The narrative constantly eludes that \"only Ken Miles is good enough to drive this race\", and yet he is constantly partnered with someone who must have been as good to maintain their success.The driving is almost secondary to the glaring errors throughout the film, but it does provide some relief from the cringeworthy American narrative. The cars do look authentic and rough; the clothing matches the era, and the design of the film on the most part is clean and period-accurate. This shouldn\\'t really come as a surprise given the profile and budget of the film, and almost makes the real issue (something I wasn\\'t focussed on but that my father did point out) even more glaring: the driving makes no sense. Miles will be \"visualising\" his perfect lap, smooth changes and steady racing, and then come race-day, will slam the gears in and yank the steering wheel round corners like nobody in an endurance race ever would. This, to me, is a killer to a film reliant on accuracy - you cannot expect the audience to respect your work if you yourselves cannot stay faithful to the source material.I wanted to like this film. I am still waiting for a film based on cars or planes to really blow me away. Dunkirk mad me sure that this sort of cinema can be done well, but they need both a director who breathes the topic, as well as a production company willing to take the financial risk to fully commit to creating this sort of feature.',\n",

It exceeded my expectations by far. This movie was not very good.The thing that bothered me most was Bale\\'s performance and it might be the worst I\\'ve ever seen him do, although that\\'s a pretty high bar.

While its unlikely Bale will walk away with any significant silverware in such a crowded year for male performances of note, there's a good chance his turn here will be fondly remembered as one of his best.With these two fantastic lead turns front and centre throughout and a raft of memorable supporting performances from the likes of the always great Jon Bernthal, the slick Josh Lucas and a scene stealing Tracey Letts as Henry Ford 2, Ford v Ferrari is the all-round package, a trial against the odds underdog story that is a film everyone should check out, not just those already in the know about this wonderful true life tale.Final Say -A winning delivery of a tried and true formula makes Ford v Ferrari a ride worth taking, further enhanced by some immaculate direction and some wondrously entertaining performances, James Mangolds racing epic is one of the year's most memorable big screen events.4 ½ ruined bags of groceries out of 5\",\n",

Well despite these \"minor\" prejudices this was a really great movie.Centering on a biopic of Ken Miles life as a racing car driving, played by Bale, and his friend Carroll Shelby, played by Damon. These two central roles were delivered with passion and some very fine acting. I could be wrong but Christian Bale\\'s diction was so much better in his native english rather than the mumbling guttural we are usually straining to unjumble.The elongated driving sequences were exhausting and to long for me but I could see others around me lapping this up. The entire ensemble were brilliant and really created the atmosphere of the racetrack and the maverick sportsmen of the 60\\'s.With regard to awards my mind tells me that there are merely supporting actor nominations here because neither of the leads here displayed any comprehensive array of emotions and that discounts them.

Christian Bale is obviously the largest standout of the films high end cast, giving another brilliant performance. Matt Damon is maybe only second best in the film, but he does a great job asd well, and provides for a perfect match for Bale's take on the character and its personality. The film is wonderfully shot, with breathtaking views, and fueled with an often pulse of excitement that truly grabs your attention the way a movie should. The film does seem to start slow, but as with cars, as it goes on longer it begins to pick up speed, making for an exciting ride. The soundtrack is also a particular standout, with an original score that fits its material better than most films this year, and a sound in general that isn't too loud or obnoxious for a racing flick. In the end, Ford v Ferrari is not perfect, but it is a car film like no other and certainly earns a chance in this years Oscar race, as if it didn't have one already.\\nMy Rating: 9.5/10\",\n",
       " \"Ford v Ferrari tells the story of the Ford Motor Company after being betrayed by Ferrari in an acquisition deal trying to design a car to compete in the 66' Le Mans race to beat Ferrari first and foremost. Henry Ford II (Letts) recruits Carol Shelby (Damon) and Ken Miles (Bale) to engineer and race a car respectively in order to finally become the first american manufactured car to win the race.As someone who was initially unfamiliar with the story of the 66' Le Mans race; what the build up to it entailed and what happened afterwards I was consistently glued to the screen. In my mind the stakes were high and anything could happen. And this story does not sugarcoat any part of the details. It is an underdog story in the sense that Ford, a much smaller underdog car company that doesn't specialize in speed is going up against a juggernaut like Ferrari, a luxury car built to be expensive and flashy is truly a race. It also shows that there is much more to racing that just speed and design, the driver plays a crucial role. A well-established relationship between the car and driver is frugal because in this race they would have to spend upwards of 24 hours together, they have to know each other and what their limits are, otherwise there will be catastrophic consequences.The acting performances are all fantastic, even if no one really has an Oscar worthy scene. Christian Bale does not quite reach his full potential but is still very transformative as a hot shot arrogant but talented driver. Matt Damon is also pretty good despite his accent not being that convincing. However the standout performance is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, who is determined to beat Ferrari at any costs, including getting into his very own car and trusting his very arrogant driver. His performance inside his own race car was both gripping and hilariously performed. The racing scenes were also very stellar, there is the typical drama that happens inside the pit, but seeing it transform from the pit to the track is really masterful build up, and what made the race scenes so engaging, as well as the directing by Mangold. If a race scene is able to craft so much motion sickness and tension by just showing a shot-reverse shot sequence, then this is a job done by a real racing enthusiast or a great director.There were however a couple of scenes that didn't really work. For example, a couple of character drama scenes. I understand we have to show the life of Ken Miles, his wife and son who are still supportive of his dream. However this really isn't a character drama movie, it is a real life dramatization of events. There are scenes that are kind of meaningless is the larger retelling of the narrative. They might have happened in real life, but there was no real payoff to any of them. For example, Shelby is shown to have a bad heart and would never race again. This is set up and doesn't pay off at all. Many scenes might be telling a real life story, but don't really affect the narrative of Ford v Ferrari. A good fifteen minutes could have been trimmed and the movie would have stayed the same.Ford v Ferrari tells an engaging story for car enthusiasts, it has enough racing to satisfy anyone who has a thirst for high speed action, who may also love stunt driving not extremely dumbed down. It can also spark an interest for people who aren't automotively challenged. It is not necessarily a masterpiece or even a Best Picture contender, but it a solid two and a half our watch. It is fast, it funny and it is thrilling most of the way.\",\n",

       " \"Director James Mangold known for many movies including Girl, Interrupted, Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma has directed the movie Ford v Ferrari based on American car designer Carroll Shelby ( excellent acting by Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale known for American psycho, The Fighter, Vice, the Big Short). Shelby knows Ken is an excellent driver and can easily compete and win a race. Ken is married to Mollie( actress Caitrona Balfe) and the couple have an adorable son Peter( Noah Jupe ..seen him in A Quiet place). Peter follows his dad to the races and autobody shop. Ken is a simple man. Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II has to decide if Ken can enter car race in Le Mans, France and represent Ford. Josh Lucas plays role of Leo Beebe , right hand man for Henry Ford II and does not like Ken's appearance and mannerisms. I particularly liked the scene when Shelby has to tell Ken that because of his image ,Ken cannot be Ford's race car driver. Matt Damon was terrific as Shelby who has money and power to make decisions in favor of Ken but has to get over hurdles created by Leo. I really enjoyed the scenes when Shelby talks to Ford about how folders had to change hands so many times before reaching Ford and impact of decision making involving too many people. Christian Bale as Ken Miles exudes enthusiasm and passion for race cars and abilities to handle speed. Miles is happy to run the race and not too concerned about winning. Jon Bernthal ( movies The wolf of wall street, The Accountant) did very well as Lee Iacocca who agrees with Shelby's faith in Ken's race car driving abilities. Good ensemble of talented actors. Oscar worthy acting by Matt Damon . 2 hrs 32 minutes of Cars, mechanics of fast cars and differences between Ford and Ferrari manufacturers was truly interesting and very well presented. Excellent Direction.\",\n",

       " \"Le Mans '66 is a fun movie despite having an overly dramatized plot. In a way this is your usual Hollywood action/drama flick with little to no regard to respecting how events originally occurred. Lifting inspiration from incidents happening around its main people - Miles and Shelby - and integrating them into their story making it more thrilling but also less believable. Ken Miles' life had enough for a whole movie but they rather incorporated made-up drama than telling about his war experience or perhaps showing that the other drivers are not just there as simple antagonists. The handling of the 'Ferrari deal' is also laughable, distorting history for the sake of extra drama. I am the first to point out that Le Mans - the '71 movie - was a kind of special something, going to the extreme with its focus on motorsport while FvF went to the other extreme where human drama is the most important and the writers did not hesitate to alter facts and sacrifice character integrity in order to serve a thrilling story. In my book this is an inferior attempt at a historic biography/racing film.\",\n",

       " '\\'Le Mans \\'66\\' (Ford v Ferrari), directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line), is a feel-good family flick that looks at the true story of Ford\\'s car designer Carroll Shelby, played by Matt Damon (The Martian) and his driver Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale (The Dark Knight) - where they go head to head with Ferrari in the 1966 \\'Le Mans\\' motorsport race.My first impression of the film, after watching the trailer, was; \"this looks and feels like \\'Rush\\'.\" 2013\\'s \\'Rush\\', directed by Ron Howard, a film I enjoyed very much - felt comforting and easy-going - even though there is a literal turn for the worse, there\\'s still a warmness to the narrative that feels very smart and cool (at all corners). I was imagining \\'Le Mans \\'66\\' to be very similar to \\'Rush\\', and thankfully it was - my expectations were met. It had all the same coolness, slick dialogue and fast story. What appealed to me during both films was their aesthetically pleasing setting. I found myself wanting to be in the South of France or Northern Italy, laying in the sun and drinking a beer. \\'Le Mans \\'66\\' draws you into to its ambience so well and it actually makes you feel present. I have watched it twice now and could easily watch it again, especially when the weather is looking grey.A few pointers - looking at the technical side of film, the pacing was good as it kept the story fun and engaging though the duration of the film could have been shorter. Some scenes were not particularly interesting or necessary. There was a lot of exposition during the first act which had me wishing for a more conversational dialogue. A lot of what happened could have been explained in a less amount of time. Even so, it wasn\\'t something I cared much about - its production value and sixties appeal had me glued to the screen. However, it was sometimes hard to settle down because of Bale\\'s, over-the-top, accentuated accent but again, as time progresses, it was not something that bothered me throughout. Having said this, I thought Shelby and Miles\\' on screen relationship was joyful and convincing. Their narrative was interesting and gave me a better understanding about a story I never knew existed. Sometimes biopics have a better way of delivering information - due to their motivating characterisations and re-imaging of crucial events. For example, the racing sequences have more emphasis than actuality, (don\\'t hold me to this - I have never been to a race in my life). However, the brilliant \\'Academy Award\\' wining sound, edited by Donald Sylvester (Logan) and the great use of camera work by cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (Nebraska) - puts you behind the wheel of the iconic \\'Ford GT40\\'.For someone that has a mild interest in cars and motorsport - I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone - especially if you have a fascination about exhaust pipes.',\n",
       " 'What exactly did Enzo Ferrari\\'s purple ink pen circle?\\nFor Car Lovers, the most anticipated movie of 2019 is \"Ford V Ferrari.\".Of course, \"Speed Car King\" as a commercial film, while restoring history, there are also deductive elements in it.Why did Ford buy Ferrari?\\nFord and Ferrari, in the 1960s, when cars were not highly globalized, were simply two car companies that could not compete.One is the American overlord who pushes automobile production into the modern process, the other is the Apennine overlord who is immersed in automobile racing.\\nThe two are on different continents and are not competitors in the same field, and their situations are even more different.1960-1970 was the golden decade age of explosive growth for Ford and all American car companies.During that decade, the annual production of individual models under Ford\\'s main brand increased from 300,000 units to nearly 800,000 units. For Ford, which is aimed at the general audience, they have enough capital to do some things in circles.\\nFerrari in the 1960s was in dire Straits, facing a situation that could not be uncovered at any time.Racing is a very expensive sport, a team behind the big boss to inject capital, the racing department needs to rely on car companies to obtain funds.At that time, Ferrari was like a single \"Iron Han Han\", no matter when and when, sports cars were only owned by minority groups.By selling sports cars, or selling racing cars to independent teams to feed the entire R & D team to form a closed-loop, this road is becoming narrower and narrower by Ferrari.Until 1963, Enzo Ferrari sat at the same negotiating table as Henry Ford II.\\nIn the case of Ford, their purpose was clear - to move into the European car market.At that time, Europe was an incremental market for American automobile companies, but there was a very embarrassing problem in front of them:At least in the field of automobiles, Americans have no sense of superiority in European land.Why was the deal called off at the last second?\\nFord wants to buy Ferrari, and Ferrari also needs to find a \"golden master dad\" as a backer. This seems to be a good deal for you. It should be smooth sailing. What exactly caused the transaction to crash?Of course, it is not because there is a \"mole.\".\\nFerrari\\'s private secretary, Franco Gozzi, wrote in an Italian car magazine about Ford\\'s acquisition of Ferrari.He referred to the clause that angered Ferrari the most and led him to walk out of the meeting - \"each item was over 450 million lire (about $257,000 at the time) of the team\\'s budget.Enzuo had to apply to Ford for approval.\"On the agreement, Enzuo circled the words \"submitted\" and \"acquired\" with his purple ink pen, and wrote \"not acceptable\" next to them.\\nEnzuo was an unruly man, and it is precisely because of his temper that he has created many popular stories in the history of automobiles.In his view, the rules and regulations given to him by Ford seriously affected his freedom of management of the team, which he had suffered for decades in the field.\\nAccording to the description of Ford Department manager Fei Lei, in the process of negotiations between the two sides for nearly a month, there are also other factors of discord.Enzuo, for example, has been critical of Shelby\\'s relationship with Ford, and his bid to enter the Indy 500 has been thwarted by Ford.',\n",
       " 'Good story telling. Gute Unterhaltung.(gute Unterhaltung)',\n",
       " 'The Shelby mythology is well fed with this film, but to be fair, Ol\\' Shel himself was always quick to praise Ken Miles, so it\\'s nice to see film that recognises the input from a truly international band of racers & hot-rodders.Matt Damon is great as Carroll Shelby, but then Damon is great almost always.... To the casual filmgoer, his wheelin\\'n\\'dealin\\' business style, his brashness and his confidence are well portrayed, but you can appreciate to his performance easier if you\\'ve seen interviews with Shelby himself.Christian Bale & Catriona Balfe are brilliant as the Miles\\'. They deliver the accent & lingo brilliantly (I was born in the same town) and I loved Bale\\'s inclusion of the Brummie phrase \"going round the Wrekin\", that shows real depth of research into the character, even if it is wasted on the vast majority of viewers... In a racing car, Bale really makes you believe that he\\'s grabbing that Cobra / GT40 and wringing out Every Last Drop of performance (watch the DVD extra\\'s to see how it was done, well worth it!) as well as fulfilling his role as development driver by constantly thinking of new ways to go fast. You get the sense that he was immersed in the jargon, not just reading it from a page... He Understands.The crew went to extra-ordinary lengths to recreate the period venues, not, thankfully, all CGI for which this film is all the better. The sight of all of those Cobra\\'s, GT40\\'s etc is enough to have one going weak at the knees (as well as the achingly gorgeous Panhard on a trailer when \\'Miles\\' first gets to Le Mans), even if it obvious that the Superformance etc. cars are the ones running bigger wheels and low-profile tyres. A nice touch, possibly as a nod to Ken Miles\\' Midlands background, is the Mini (Austin, not BMW) sitting outside his garage.The Ford politicking is central to the theme and, for dramatic tension is exaggerated somewhat. You can imagine Henry Ford II acting in that imperious manner, but any film needs a true villain and Leo Beebe (quite harshly in many opinions) carries that particular torch through to the films end.Just like Steve McQueen\\'s Magnum Opus, \\'Le Mans\\', the hero doesn\\'t win through in the end, coming second. Like many sporting controversies, there is opinion, denial, conjecture & opposing sides about the manufactured finish.Interestingly though, the film has the cars finishing in a perfect line abreast, whereas in real life, Bruce McLaren sped up slightly at the end also, unlike the film, Shelby was also instrumental, with Beebe, in orchestrating the \\'dead heat\\' although once the French officials had wreaked their havoc, he always went on record as having bitterly regretted denying Miles the 66 \\'Triple Crown\\'.It\\'s a bittersweet epilogue where Miles is killed, I guess the films intention was to show how much of a racer he was and, even after getting shafted by Ford, was still intent on making their car faster & better...In summary, ignore the historical stuff, you\\'ve got Wikipedia for that. Simply turn up the volume and enjoy the best motor racing film since \\'Le Mans\\'. Only with more dialogue. And plot.',\n",

This is how car racing scenes are supposed to be done. The photography is extremely dynamic and immersive, you feel part of the competition.

       " \"Fantastic movie. I know nothing about cars yet this film captured me and held me 'til the end. I found myself feeling the tension and adrenaline of the races. The characters are easy to root for, they feel authentic, real and, most of all, imperfect. The conflict comes mostly from the inside of Ford, which was very interesting to me. Ferrari is a secondary source of conflict, way behind the own suit men of Ford.The only things I'd change are very small. Sometimes, we got intercuts from the adrenaline of the races to Miles' wife and son at home listening to the radio. This was frustrating to me. I wanted to see the races, where the action was, and I felt there were a little too many of these intercuts. Also, Miles' arc felt slightly unmotivated to me. I never understood what made him decide to actually accept and tie the race with the other two Ford cars. Even Carroll Shelby's petition wasn't a very intense one, as to make Miles change his whole personality for it.All and all, this is a fantastic movie, with a great script and great performances, and it definitely is worth a watch.\",\n",

As far as historical accuracy, they just about nailed everything except for the Rolex 24 scene which is set in Daytona, Florida but was filmed at the LA area Auto Club Speedway. This makes sense and isn't a huge issue unless you are a racing fanatic such as myself. As for Ford V Ferrari, at times you really forget that Ferrari are the main antagonists. Ford V Shelby would be a more accurate albeit less marketable title. My issues with the film are that runtime is a little long and few scenes are somewhat cringy(Miles and his wife driving down the road and Miles and Shelby getting into a fight).

       " '\"Ford v Ferrari\" isn\\'t as much about the battle between the two mega-corporations in the title as much as it is about the fight between bureaucracy and action, calculations and instinct or faith and palpability. It involves internal struggles as much as external ones and carried superbly by its two leads, Matt Damon and Christian Bale--whose performance is Oscar-worthy--is one of the most likable, satisfying and entertaining movies of the year.The plot heads towards an epic culmination at the 1966 24-hour Le Mans race in France and it involves the years in which Ford created the now legendary GT40 to finally beat Ferrari who has been dominating the racing realm of motoring for years. It follows car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they deal with the technical ins and outs, corporate interference and media standards navigating their vagaries to get to success. The movie is as old-school macho as its central characters. Shelby was an American maverick, always dressing like the boss he is, always determined to get the job done, but he was understanding of the business side. Miles, on the other hand, is as complicated as he is a brilliant driver. His approach to the world is stripped of formality, his driving is his religion and people should be as real as he is otherwise they become fodder for his unfiltered words.James Mangold knew he was entering a world with high potential in entertainment when he approached this story. Whenever attempting to encompass American history, one tends to sensationalize through patriotism and venerate the people it contains. And indeed they are worthy of veneration. This plays out like standard Hollywood fare, the dream factory working its magic perfectly. But it\\'s also very male-centric. Not only its characters look like they were made in a car factory, the women are also hysterical. A particular scene in which Ken\\'s wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) has a nervous breakdown during an argument with Ken about him hiding his plan to work on the new GT40 is a bit exaggerated. As they are in their family car, she starts driving erratically and dangerously, the scene playing like an interrogation scene. \"I thought we loved this stuff!\"--she yells until Ken spits everything out. Yet in the end, she is fine with it, she just wished he hadn\\'t lied. Her worries are understandable and called for, but her over-the-top reaction Mangold decided upon is obsolete as representation for women--even if this was the 1960s.In the end, though, \"Ford v Ferrari\" finishes with just the right amount of satisfaction. While both characters are likable and Bale\\'s performance rules, Matt Damon\\'s portrayal of Carroll Shelby is what really made me up this movie\\'s grade. He is perfect as men who try to get the job done but also not upset anyone too much. His approach to Ford\\'s CEO, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) on why he should get a second chance after losing in 1965\\'s Le Mans is as elegant as it is harsh and true. Even if \"Ford v Ferrari\" seems a bit outdated it is nonetheless a movie which really wants to be liked--not only by car people, but by everyone. Well, it succeeded.',\n",

Everything this film was screamed \"YOU WILL HATE THIS MOVIE, JOHN!\" I\\'ve never been one to care about cars, or racing and definitely not films focused on that, but wow this film was executed damn near perfectly. Mansgold creates an intriguing conflict and dialogue. To no surprise we also get superb acting from Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Then you have an amazing supporting cast with the likes of Noah Jupe, Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Josh Lucas and Tracy Letts. Josh Lucas played the perfect \"douche bag who thinks he\\'s too good for everyone and everything\" and has a very punchable face which made the ending to this film relatively bitter-sweet (if you\\'ve seen this film you know what I mean). I was so afraid of this film being what every film with cars is and that\\'s \"turn left, then turn right, then turn left, reverse and do a 180, turn left again\" and I can\\'t even begin to explain how much that irks me, but this film is beautifully paced and is edited so well that I was actually on the edge of my seat waiting to see what the outcome would be.CONCLUSION:\\nWhat I tell everyone is that this is the \"Green Book\" of 2019. Obviously, very different subject matter, however, the very well made, emotional, warm, sad, happy and crowd pleasing type of film worthy of an Oscar nomination. So, regardless if you\\'re a fan of cars or racing I recommend this to everyone. 8.7/10.',\n",
       " \"Great movie. Go and see it. It's got all sorts of emotions.\\nMatt Damon and Christian Bale are superb.\",\n",
       " \"This was a very enjoyable filmIt is a feel-good, underdog wins, suits win only the hollowest of battle victories, good guys when all the wars.The driving scenes were great, and I don't care if the gear shifting was technically correct. There were a few memorably intense acting scenes: Tracy Lett's reaction to being driven in a great racing car by a great racing car driver. Christian Bale being driven in a station wagon by an absolutely ferocious wife (Caitriona Balfe) stick in my mind.After watching this movie I wanted to see what else Caitriona Balfe has acted in - I've watched a few episodes of Outlander and have been really impressed by her ferocity on screen. Not merely noisy -- but oozing heartfelt intensity.Oh - the cinematography, editing and sound were all world class.As an afterthought--Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe are two of the handsomest stars I've ever seen. This production discourages seeing them that way. Bale looks lean, hungry, and slightly weird in most scenes; Caitriona Balfe is not much past ordinary in appearance. The other racing movies this one is compared to are about beautiful people who occasionally need to change out of their racing duds so they can send them to the cleaners before dropping by the club for hors d'oeuvres and aperitifs.The --uh, restrained--comparisons with Rush, LeMans and Grand Prix may be justified, but I fully enjoyed this movie. If you like cars, competition, various versions of excessive testosterone,--a number of interesting cultural interactions, I think you'll enjoy it too.Not deep, not technically fulfilling, but clear and interesting story-telling, and cinematically beautiful movie-making all the way through.\",\n",
       " \"Being a hardcore fan of Christian Bale, I rarely miss any of his movies. But his portrayal of the legendary racer and racing car developer Ken 'Bulldog' Miles in 'Ford vs Ferrari' has simply swept me off my feet. This is a brilliant depiction of the early days rivalry between the car giants Ford and Ferrari where corporate egos of Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari changed the complexion of the motorcar racing in the days to come. Amidst such hard hitting and nail biting corporate egos, what stand tall are the personal ethos, values and camaraderie of the great racers Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles and their everlasting bonding and love and trust for each other and how the machines they rode redefined the very word 'Excellence' and showed the world that greatness originates from not coming first in a race or grabbing a trophy, but from sheer passion for excellence and value addition to life. Bale as the maverick Miles or Matt Damon as his trustworthy friend and mentor Caroll Shelby deliver one of the finest performances of their illustrious careers. Its so good to get back the great Matt Damon in his pristine form after a prolonged hiatus. His restrained emotions and Bale's over the top passion are the two unmatched gems of this brilliant treasure trove. If you want to be entertained for 140 minutes without a single moment of boredom or experience adrenaline rush throughout, 'Ford vs Ferrari' is a must watch for you. One of the finest works on real life motivation, I would strongly recommend this biopic to everyone who think beyond the parochial feelings of rat race or monetary success. Certainly it is going to bag many awards in the coming months. One of the finest Hollywood movies in the past decade. Miss it at your own risk.\\nP. S- I am not an F1 freak, yet I loved every frame of it. Such is the power of this movie...\",\n",

       " \"Kick it into 7000 rpm and enjoy a brief ride through history when considering watching this solid film, Ford Versus Ferrari. The exhilarating true story behind the 1966 24 hour Le Mans race serves as a story for the crossing paths between Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) and the eccentric British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and how they come together to take down Enzo Ferrari and show ford off as a top contender.Director James Mangold takes on the American story that rewrote racing history displaying some of the most exciting scenes we have seen this year in 2019. From the drivers POV to the spectators POV, we are taking a journey with all who witnessed this great victory and the events that lead up to it.As failing Henry Ford II seeks out an idea to save his late fathers company, he takes initiative to challenge Ferrari in a race of perfection by hiring Carol Shelby, designer extraordinaire of Shelby American. The issue for Shelby is that he can design cars , but he knows the best driver is Ken Miles, Who seems arrogant to him at first. Ken Miles is a car guru who spends his days either fixing cars or racing them. Putting aside there differences, we are found with the dynamic duo who creates the perfect ford GT to shake up the reign Ferrari has claimed for years.Put two all star actors together and you'll witness the closest thing we can get to time traveling following the bond between miles and Shelby. Matt Damon seals the deal on being a confident determined Shelby while Christian Bale displays another change physically along with his arsenal of character traits that help him depict roles perfectly. Up close and personal cinematic shots kept viewers eyes glued to the screen as we were passengers to Ken Miles amazing race. With this, and a strong supporting cast, and a great musical score to evoke emotion, Ford vs Ferrari scores an 8.5/10. There is a such thing as a perfect lap.\",\n",
       " 'You know you are totally hooked to this movie when you are planning watching it in your bed, and you end up watching it all the way seated in it, rivated to the screen, unable to move, deeply absorbed.What an exhilarating ride that was. And what, again, an amazing performance by Christian Bale. Certainly one the greatest actor of our time.',\n",
       " \"This movie was a great documentary of what actually happened, and I learned a lot. I've always loved the Ford GT and Shelby products. I have a 2014 Mustang myself. I like the fact that people were real in this movie.. acted like and looked at things the way they probably did back then. Everybody wants what they want, and some people end up getting burned because of it. This is corporate America. It's not the 2000s when people started getting greedy. They always have been. It's unfortunate how things turned out for Ken Miles. Feel sorry for the guy. All in all a great movie and keeps you on the edge of your seat at the end.\",\n",
       " \"I am no knowing that much about cars history ,but i find this movie to be quite entertaining ,tension of the races is sended to the viewer in form of emotions,adrenalyne,excitment,passion,perfection,work and last but not least the dedication.Americans should be proud of such movie productions ,because this movie teach you so many things ,beside the history parts of it , you can learn what engineers were struggling to work for back in those times ,how races evolvee cars aerodynamics,power,breaks and every single system of the cars.Now i knowed some parts about these from university ,since we learn more about cars construction history and we been told that the races made car producers to evolvee them products due to competivity ,etc.. . So i am glad this movie come out ,and that there can be people who can feel those things , who can understand further the work of an engineer , and how much work those car companies put into developing newer and better cars ,but also show the work behind a succesful company !! is them engineers/workers and dedication.You must not pass over this , is just so delightful to watch it ,even if i didn't had the luck to see races happening real life (in Romania).i still curse those days ,when a high speed circuit was planned to be builded and been canceled! by politics changes and coruption.. .So those who have acces to those things, appreciate the opportunity of taking part to such a race.\",\n",
       " 'Well this has to be one of the greatest race car movies ever. Performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale are so, so good... there is real chemistry between their acting, really good. This is one movie you watch and have the urge to watch it all over again',\n",
       " \"Fantastic interpretation from Christian Bale. One of his bests.\\nNice balance of comedy and drama. I don't fully understand the character development of some of the protagonists. The side cast (wife, petty vice president) feels kinda cliché; I like the interaction, even though they don't provide enough conflict. The main antagonist, Ferrari, has some nice shots but they're not a real threat because we're too immersed into the main character's personal struggle for perfection.\\nThat finale, that missing victory, gives a lot of weight to the whole final act and to the good relationships between Miles and Shelby. But if we look at being and end point, it really says much. I'm a bit disappointed yet happy about the overall movie.\",\n",
       " \"Ford v. Ferrari isn't only the best racing movie of the decade, it's also one of 2019s years strongest films, and I'm just as surprised as you are reading that. I went in with relatively high expectations just due to the director, and I came out with a whole new appreciation for the sport. Mangold puts you front and forward in the action, with some really impressive shots, the technical aspects alone make this one worth watching. But at its core this is a character driven piece with two career best performances from Bale and Damon as Shelby and Miles, who not only have their own issues to deal with, but also that of the big Ford corporation, and a race they are not willing to lose. This film has a bit of everything, from the personal tolls this project has on Miles and his wife and kid, to the exciting 24 hour race, or the inner workings of big business and what crooks they can be, Ford v. Ferrari is a perfect crowd pleasing movie, and overall one that I personally can't wait to watch again.I give Ford v. Ferrari 5 stars out of 5\",\n",
       " 'Loved this move.More or less historically aligned, if not entirely accurate.However, great acting, some humour and lots of cars ... from start to finish.',\n",
       " \"My family members keep wanting to go back. I've enjoyed it all three times. Christian Bale became a different person in the show. I forgot it was him and was totally into the character. Matt Damon's portrayal of Shelby also was excellent.\",\n",
       " \"I wasn't expecting too much when I went to the theaters to view this film. I really just wanted to see it for the racing but this movie delivered so much more. I found myself in love with Ken Miles (ChristianBale) and Carolyn Shelby (Matt Damon). It's more of a Shelby v. Corporate than Ford v. Ferrari. Everything in this film is real and fantastic! It maybe my favorite film of the year and it's one of the only ones witch made me cry. If you have a chance to view this film I highly recommend it. I know it won't beat 1917 for beat Oscar but it damn well deserves it.\",\n",
       " \"What an awesome evening I just experienced! Drawn into the music, scenery, old time 70's feel which is and will always be the best movie era of movie making period!\\nAll the perfect flowing racing, chivalry, the cars in that era and of course beat on acting. I can't say enough and won't anymore, just watch the movie and zone out to just yourself and you'll have flashbacks to your own era if you were around in them years.\\nWay to go to everyone who made this movie!\",\n",
       " 'This movie was tremendously exhilarating, I found myself pumped with energy all the way through. Also, the score... the score kept me going. Beautiful story, which I vaguely knew of, it was perfectly written and executed. That being said, Matt Damon and Christian Bale made the perfect combination, they managed to portray their characters to perfection, they had great chemistry and I hope I get to see them working together again in the future. Once again Bale steals the show, what an actor.\\n1000% recommended watch. Even if you knew the story or not, this film will give you that thrill. Incredible, very well deserved Oscar nominations!',\n",

Perfect and nail-biting action and also very emotional .\\nA must watch for all racing fans.Kudos to James Mangold and the rest of the crew.',\n",
       " \"Yes, I could mention the fanatical leave-nothing-to-chance, try-anything-first, do-anything, gear-headed, rugged doggedness, that only sheer will and deep intestinal fortitude that Christian Bale's Ken Miles displayed in his skill and commitment who gave audiences a lesson on how to handle his car to get it done. Or, I could discuss that character appropriation we can always expect from Phenom actor Matt Damon's portrayal of Carroll Shelby that he so graciously offered fans which ascended everything that was steered only by the great Jon Bernthal's Lee Iacocca interpretation as the boundless pit crew lead; they all literally appeared to actually be haunted by these portrayals throughout the story. This come-from-behind tale gave viewers a true appreciation of the infamous competitive history of two top-tiered car manufacturer icons Ford and Ferrari's chronological past... but to me, to me...the love story between Ken and Mollie Miles played by Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe shined bright like a diamond amidst all of the steel, rubber and tire dust. The unspoken communication they shared, the connection that they had, the space they entrusted and gifted one another to express their individual emotions, ambitions and needs is what real love looks like. Great Job!\",\n",
       " \"The GOOD: The cast is phenomenal. Matt Damon is perfect as a chicken farmer from Texas. Christian Bale plays a short tempered British person almost to perfectly. Josh Lucas portal of a ford executive with a determination to ruin the GT is just frustrating enough to be convicting. Jon Bernthal finally gets to play a likeable character who has a job to do at first, then just becomes part of the solution.The writting is also beautiful in more ways than one. You need to pay attention to the little things, as they tend to come back up later on. Its also poetic in nature, from one scene to another. Thing's that are said, and things that happen have a deeper meaning and you have to be ready with a box of tissues. This shouldn't be considered a spoiler: when Henry Ford II is talking to Shelby about going to war should go down as one of the greatest moments in film history. That conversation represents both characters and the true life story of Ford Vs. Ferrari perfictly!Not to mention the love story between Ken and his wife feels real. No relationship is perfect; she doesn't want him to quit and shes not going to stand back and watch him throw his life away. The other side of that situation, he wants to be a race car driver, but he needs to put food on the table. I can reallynfeel the love between these characters, and I feel for them.Set design, props, and costumes were so on point for each character, location and clothing that when the movie was over I felt like a time traveler. This film just did such a great job of pulling you into its world. Not to mention the cars!!! I love how Shelby drove a AC Cobra throughout the movie and Ken trashed the Mustang. Again, this movie does a great job of just keeping you drawn to the plot so well.The BAD: I felt like it ran long in some places. Especially towards the end. This movie could of, and should of ended after the race. You already ended the movie with captions, why not add a few more. On the topic of the captions; they're to fast. Im not a spead reader, leave them on the acreen fornat least 5 seconds.\\nThis is fsr and away my favorite movie of 2019! I was hooked from beginning to end. I would even love to see another racing movie based on Lancia's really history.\",\n",
       " \"With this movie you understand that exist two kinds of movies, blockbuster movies and real acting movies!\\nChristian Bale and Matt Damon has a perfect chemistry!\\nBale leave you for one more time with your mouth open with his acting...\\nThank you all for this movie, it's a triumph and a perfect legasy for Ken Miles and Carol Shelby!\",\n",
       " \"Christian BaleThe chameleon with his thick British accent and goofy behaviour almost moulds into Ken Miles, the maverick British Race car driver. The role is played to such perfection that you can lick Christian and actually taste racing grease. He breathes his soul to the cagaracter and it's almost impossible to comprehend and this man could have done something else with his life in the meanwhile, upto Ford Vs.

Indeed, a chameleon😎😀\",\n",

       " \"F you didn't know who Carroll Shelby was, you don't know about car racing or about automotive performance, period. I didn't know who Kenneth Henry Miles (Ken Miles) was before this movie, so that makes me almost as poor and would-be connoisseur as you, almost. Anyway, this movie is for us racing enthusiasts and also for those who enjoy a good movie, in that the performances of the actors, the script, the direction and technical aspects mesh so well that you get immersed in the story, fictional or not; this movie was not fictional, but almost mythical if you revere the sport of car racing. It still is an awesome movie if you're not a sports car buff, because it shines in depicting human personality and character.The days when grand prix racing and endurance racing was as much about the iconic drivers as it was about the machines, and both made newspaper headlines, those days have changed. Rarely do either make headlines anymore, other than in specialty magazines. I can't say things have changed that much since the 60's with respect to the drivers but they sure were more demanding on them in that time in history than they are today; thanks to people like Jackie Stewart, the sport is driver safety aware where it was all about the speed and winning years ago.That emotional drive to win was consuming for the rare few who were at the top of their game and that is what transpired for me in this movie. You'll see two men, Shelby and Miles, played respectively by Matt Damon and Christian Bale, who became best friends because they shared one thing that set both of them apart from others, even though their personalities were different, they were true professionals and the best. Movies are not made about people who aren't exceptional and this movie proves that point as much as it shows exceptional people are also very ordinary and like you and me in all other manners except for that thing which makes them exceptional.A good movie should take you on an emotional ride, pun very much intended, and this one will do that.

For viewers of a certain age, seeing Shelby Cobras, Ford GTs, Ferraris, Corvette Stingrays, and other iconic racing cars (or their computerized recreations) from the 1960s chew up the tracks feels like putting on old, comfortable shoes. The cinematography and what has to be a ton of CGI (verified in the credits) plus the pounding, distorted, absolutely perfect guitar music really make this movie for me. I remember seeing the movie \"Gran Prix\" in the 1960s. It set the bar for car-racing movies. This movie attains the same level of gritty realism.

You don't have to be a car fan to like this movie but if you can imagine yourself sitting in the seat of these exceptional machines you will ride every curve and straightway of this movie. It is fun. It is well performed. It is well written. It is great personal drama. I give this movie an 8 (great) out of 10. {True Life Drama}\",\n",

While Matt puts in a sophisticated performance as a racer-turned-businessman, it is Bale who rules the little-longer-than-needed film time. The characters have been drawn out beautifully in the early part of the movie & the crux of the Ford vs Ferrari rivalry hits the peak during the climax. A special mention goes out to the child actor who portrays Miles' kid for betraying the innocence & excitement of the racing phenomena which swept the early 60s. If you enjoyed Ron Howard's Rush for the personal rivalry of James Hunt vs Nicki Lauda, you should definitely watch out as the giants Automobiles lock horns through the amazing driving skills of its racers.

There's some kind of seasoning that the actors' performances and the movie itself added which makes every scene enjoyable, rather than a dull plus boring one.The performances of Bale and Damon, I don't have to say much. Their qualities are above all, especially Bale who had always played his role leaving a unique impression on the audience.

Damon and Bale portrayed their characters extremely convincing and kept me engaged until the end, strongly cheering for the maverick underdogs fighting competition and corporate pressure.This was based on a true story and in the end, pushing yourself to the extreme is the only way to find out who are you and what you are made of on your path to greatness.',\n",

Bale was as stupendous as could be; possibly one of the best we\\'ve seen him in in quiet a while. Damon was no less astounding in his own right.\\nIt won\\'t be wrong to say that one of its greatest technical achievements lies in the fact that you don\\'t necessarily have to be a \"car-guy\" to be able to commend this marvel. Another commendable fact was that despite being based on a true story, it had us giving a slight feeling of unpredictability at points, which was, in fact, a sight to behold. Also, in spite of being a tad bit long, it never even seemed to lose grip of the plot.The monstrous sound of the roaring engines could be felt throughout the entirety of the theatre, so even if a \"non-car-guy\" feels bored, these blaring sounds won\\'t let him sleep. The final act was a bit of a let-down which was not what I expected to be the outcome.\\nAll-in-all a feature rife with intensity, emotions, breakdowns (technical and emotional) and an over-the-top sound design which suffices for an individual to enable him to say that he is a member of such a cinephilic community that prides itself on being able to witness such level of filmmaking.

The sounds were great, the straight-cut gears in the gearbox whining louder and higher as the car accelerates, with the staccato of an almost-no-exhaust V8, all piped through THX speakers is close to a religious experience, especially as very few of us got to hear this monster live.\\nActing is on point, finally a movie where Christian Bale doesn't have to fake an American accent, Matt Damon pulls off a seemingly effortless Carrol Shelby - no doubt weeks and weeks of acting work and watching Shelby interviews went into it, but the whole movie just feels like one of those special ones, where the actors just enjoyed themselves.\",\n",

Bale and Damon are simply stupendous, showing a real sensitivity in the more dramatic moments while showcasing their charisma and comedic chops in performances that rank among the year's best. F v.

Few of us are able to embrace that chance to become the best versions of ourselves and set benchmarks for generations to follow. This movie celebrates that spirit of pursuit of perfection at one's craft both individually and as a team.Caroll Shelby & Phil Remington built and Ken Miles raced the Ford Shelby GT 40 which defeated the most brilliantly engineered cars at the time - The Ferrari in the most demanding and enduring race in the world - 24 hours of LeMans in 1966 and it went on to win for 4 consecutive years. And to date, it remains the only American car to do so.Yes, the movie has all the adrenaline pumping, engine revving, nail-biting action that we expect from a race car movie. But it goes much beyond that by bringing out the amazing comradery and personal journeys of Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles. It shows how a small team of committed and talented people who set themselves an impossible target can actually make God (Ferrari) bleed by sheer will power, raw talent, and good old hard work. It also beautifully shows how family believes in you when others give up.Christian Bale and Matt Damon are impeccable.Visuals are awesome, all real cars, real drivers, shot from the perspective of the driver - Behind the wheel and on the track. Above all, the perfect harmony of man and machine with endurance is on display here.\",\n",

This excellent movie is less about the ins and outs of particular races than about two of the men behind one actual attempt to give America a presence in the toughest race of all. It's a wonderfully American story though one of the men is an expatriate Brit, Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale like he was born to play this role. The part is the true center of the film despite Matt Damon's strong performance and that of numerous supporting players. I will truly be surprised if this movie doesn't sweep all the award shows.\",\n",

Even though the title suggests \" Ford v Ferrari \" but at the core it is really more about Shelby --Miles v Ford Executives.\\nThe movie is able to capture the relation b/n Miles and Shelby as they build a car to race @ Le Mans . As you get to know what Le Mans is you realize the pace of the movie and at the end why is it that you really liked it.The movie is set with mild to Intense racing scenes which can be said as one of the trait of the movie as it doesn\\'t let you on the edge of the seat but rather lets you enjoy sitting back. As to acting with Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Jon Bernthal and other brilliant supporting cast it is what you expect. Even though the screen time is less between Bale and Balfe (Wife ) you will love it.\\nAt the end you will feel satisfied when you come out of the Hall and wish no more with the end and lingering feeling which will stay with you for some time.',\n",
       " 'My Review - Ford V Ferrari\\nMr rating. 8.5 /10I don\\'t have the slightest interest in car racing or cars but this story and its characters held my interest for 152 minutes and that in my opinion is the test of good directing by James Mangold ( Walk the Line ,Wolverine Logan) and a great ensemble cast of actors.Ford V Ferrari is based on a true story like nearly every movie these days and centres around the two main characters Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as racing car driver Ken MilesThe bones of the story you can view in the trailer but the flesh and blood is in the great script by Jason Keller and brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth who were named recipients of the Writers Guild of America West\\'s 2011 Paul Selvin Award for their screenplay for the film Fair Game (2010), directed by Doug Liman and starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.The story is basically described in IMBD as American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.For me it was the characters that got me in not the great action car racing scenes\\nMatt Damon as usual gives a great performance but it\\'s Christian Bale that steals the film he\\'s a great dad and husband and very funny at times but doesn\\'t suffer fools graciously and has attitude plus to anyone who tries to come between him and his passion of racing. I wouldn\\'t be at all surprised if Christian Bale is nominated for an Oscar next year for this role of course he\\'ll lose it to Joaquin Phoenix for Joker.Matt Damon is his friend and champion when the self interested Ford Corporate bosses try to edge Ken Miles out as their driver as in their eyes he\\'s not a \"Ford Man.\"\\nHenry Ford 11 played so well by Tracy Letts is a pig and runs his Ford Empire with fear that includes one scene in which he shuts of the machines and threatens his workers . Josh Lucas as Leo Beebe Fords Director of Special vehicles and the executive nemesis of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles is also great in this perfectly balance ensemble cast of actors .Ken Miles wife Mollie played by Catriona Balfe gets a special mention as does Noah Jupe as Miles son Peter they are both so convincing and it reinforces my empathy with families of racing car drivers and all daredevil pursuits that they can never be sure if their loved one will come home after a race.I thoroughly recommend seeing Ford V Ferrari it\\'s one of the best movies of the year.',\n",
       " \"With it's fast pace and long runtime, this movie doesn't waste your time. It tells a beautiful story of two men achieving what was thought impossible at the time, and about the people who helped them make it happen.It was a lot of fun, better than I expected, and emotional. There were some scenes that almost made me cry due to the fact I was so invested in the characters. Christian and Matt have an insane amount of chemistry together.The only flaw I could find was that they portray Ferrari too negatively at times, as if the story needs an antagonist. It was annoying since I like Ferrari, however, it doesn't take away from the movie at all. I understood the decision.\",\n",
       " \"It is a well scripted, well directed movie with great camera work and right blend of emotions. Bale Damon's duo works out perfectly.\",\n",
       " \"By far the best racing movie in decades!! The racing scenes are incredible and the acting is award worthy. Being a dihard car guy, I believe I noticed a slight flaw in one scene, which is the only reason I didn't give it a 10 out of 10 rating. During an early race scene (1963?) it showed several Corvettes competing, however one of them had a 1967 stinger hood. Anyway, since I'm planning on going a second time, I'll keep an eye out for it and correct my review if I was wrong =)\",\n",
       " '\"Sometimes words...they are just not useful.

This was totally an engineer\\'s wet dream, but you don\\'t really need to be a keen follower of motor sports to understand the movie. Rather, you will be compelled to research on it after you make the exit.Most people will be deterred from watching it, just by looking at the runtime, but trust me, it\\'s totally worth it. Everyone is in such fine form that it makes the watch a really pleasant one. Matt Damon as the iconic Carroll Shelby hits it out of the park. The lady playing Ken Miles\\' wife was fantastic and that scene where she has a bout of hysteria in a speeding car was definitely my favourite.Go for this one. It\\'s really a spectacle.',\n",
       " 'How is the destiny of mankind interwoven with the machines we create? Quite powerfully in myriad ways I think we\\'d all agree. That intersection of man and machine becomes singularly pure in the realm of automobile racing.One of the great true stories is that of Ferrari\\'s snubbing of Henry Ford II\\'s attempt to buy into racing via purchasing Enzo Ferrari\\'s company. Taking the insult personal Henry Ford became a man obsessed with winning LeMans and de-throning Ferrari.Ford winning LeMans, It\\'s a mission no one at the time thought was possible and it rested upon much more than money, engineering, and sheet metal. Two men played pivotal roles not only having an impossible goal to chase, but fighting a corporate culture with zero understanding of how to get out of the way and let them do it.These two men persevered under the corporate interference which often hurt as much as bank-rolled their mission. That two-man juggernaut core was Carol Shelby and Ken Miles. Two very different personalities who often clashed yet had a mutual respect for one another much like brothers of different mothers. While the quest to beat Ferrari and win LeMans provides the back drop for the saga, it is the two men, their relationship, and their success which defines the achievement. Ford v Ferrari as a racing movie is great, but it\\'s these two characters that give it the blood of humanity. Matt Damon as Carol Shelby and Christian Bale as Ken Miles are utterly fantastic in bringing these two to life on screen. Especially Bale as Miles, he literally assumes what you\\'d imagine the real man was like in a kind of \"beyond acting\" if you will. Engrossing.Speaking of engrossing. The cinematography and realism of racing reaches new levels here. In both sight and sound. Framing of shots, colors that jump, and a stealthy soundtrack that provides great atmosphere while never overtaking shows tremendous craft in filmmaking. The film pulls one in as if there was a personal stake involved. That, again, is the human factor. One which surmounts great odds while taking life chances in order to conquer and succeed. I find little fault with this film and think it will be enjoyed by masses who have little or no interest in racing. Quite simply one enjoyable film whose long length is neither tedious or superfluous. I highly recommend seeing Ford v Ferrari. The fact it adheres closely to the true events make it even more remarkable.',\n",
       " \"I knew something great was going to come out from the pairing of Christian Bale and Matt Damon in Ford V Ferrarri and I was not disappointed at all. It had what I expected: interesting characters, great acting, thrilling car races. What I did not expect was corporate culture, which had Jon Bernthal play Lee Iaccocca. This added element made the movie even more interesting because you know the protagonists are already fighting an impossible task of beating Ferrarri while having to battle corporate interference. It is the battle between doers and the suits. Bale is one of the rare actors who transforms in every role he is and you immediately forget he was once Batman driving an insane Batmobile. The same goes for Damon and Bernthal. You completely forget Damon used to be Jason Bourne and Bernthal the Punisher. The funniest part is Bale's brawl with Damon as shown in the trailer. I like how Ferrarri is not vilified in the movie, since I am a Ferrarri fan. But on the other hand I truly root for Bale's Ken Miles and Damon's Carroll Shelby to win. This is a movie about two guys struggling to do the impossible while battling outside interference from non experts. This situation is very relatable. The race scenes are exhilarating. The soundtrack blends with the action resulting in a pulsepounding thrill ride. I am even more amazed that this is a true story, but am sure that without the capable directing by James Mangold, and the excellent performances brought by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, this movie would definitely fail.\",\n",

I'm not a big fan of Matt Damon and he would not have been my first choice for Shelby, but after viewing the film I cannot say that he wasn't the right choice. The acting was spot on and the story was well told. Likely my favorite racing movie of all time. Entertaining and moving\",\n",

I loved boh the performances of ALL actors as well as the life-like race cars and how they are driven and how they behave in different situations. If you are not a racing fan, there will be plenty to enjoy, but knowing a thing or two about cars, gearboxes and RPMs helps.\\nThe only thing that I didn't care for were few minor historically innacurrate details, which were added for entertainment value, I imagine. One, here or there, I could live with, but when they are piled up, and don't help the story, they should be left out.\\nOther than those minor complaints, which is why I give it 9 instead of 10 stars, the film is as close to perfect as one can get.\",\n",

Expect to be enthralled by the characters (I absolutely love the dynamic between Ken Miles and Shelby), but even more so by the movie itself. At some points suspense had me ready to jump off my seat. Humor always kicked in at just the right moments too.\\nI feel like the movie is sending a message about trying to find the balance between trusting yourself, leading, and trusting others, following them, in order to speed to your goals without exploding. That\\'s what I got from it, and if I\\'m right about the message, I think it\\'s a good one.\\nFeel like this review is turning out a bit messy, but like Shelby says in the movie, sometimes \"words just are not useful.\"\\nJust know, the movie\\'s pretty darn good.',\n",

In fact my better half was the prime mover in us seeing Ford V Ferrari, James Mangold\\'s clearly, fairly true story of Ford\\'s attempts to achieve dominance over perennial podium finishers, the Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France. This surprisingly entertaining and thrilling story is told through the eyes of Ford\\'s chief contracted hirelings, Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby, and his preferred driver, the abrasive, but extremely talented Ken Miles. Shelby, an ex race car driver and Le Mans winner, will build the race car, whilst Miles, a failed small businessman, will hopefully achieve the desired result on the track. The story, as written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller, essentially sees Shelby and Miles, facing Ferrari on the track, but at the same time, having to wage war with powerful Ford executives, to insure the project remains their creation, rather than become some manipulated corporate play thing.This is essentially the plot, though just like any good drive, there are plenty of twists and turns along the journey to the waved checkered flag at the end of the big race. As the 2 leads, Matt Damon (Shelby) and Christian Bale (Miles) are excellent, with Bale. especially shining as the idiosyncratic, volatile Miles, who only ever appears to fully let his guard down, when in the company of his beloved wife and son. The chameleon like Bale, for once coming close to speaking in his natural English dialect, delivers yet another vivid characterization along the lines of his Oscar-winning performance as the broken ex-boxer Dicky in The Fighter. In what transparently is very much a \"boys with big toys\" movie, Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, succeeds in stamping a lasting, if only moderate, female presence in a narrative. peopled mainly by men battling to establish, corporate, sporting and at times social superiority over their rivals and perceived enemies. As a contrast, Shelby (who sounds like he had one hell of a private/domestic life ... married 7 times I think) deliberately remains a cypher domestically in Ford v Ferrari.Visually and technically the film looks and sounds fantastic, really adding to the experience and adrenaline rush of an elite motorsport film. Kudos of course to the extensive list of stunt drivers, who make it all happen. But the transitions between actors and professional drivers are seamless. By the time the admittedly engrossing climactic stretch rolls around after an arguably overlong 2+ hours, Ford v Ferrari has certainly confirmed its place as a solid reality - based drama that will undoubtedly fare best among car buffs, but can be very much appreciated by confirmed passengers like myself.',\n",
       " 'When you watch a good movie, the movie still runs in your veins after its over, the words run in your head.I could feel Ken Miles and understand the struggle Shelby made. Once the movie started , it just kept getting better and better and knowing that its based on a real story - getting to audience to feel what a man felt years ago is nothing short of extraordinary.I dont want to say much. But after interstellar this is one movie that is worthy of your time and attention.',\n",
       " \"Don't believe in collective honor, it's just a trap to let you lose everything!\",\n",
       " 'This movie was so good, I had to go to the movie theaters to watch it more than once.',\n",
       " \"Good movie and I don't even like racing. What a disappointment on the part of Henry Ford's ethics, though.\",\n",
       " \"First of all, I would like to say that I am not exactly a big fan of racing cars. For that same reason, it took me a while to see this film, despite all the great prizes and nominations it won. As I mentioned earlier, I was a little skeptical, but I can conclude that it really is an extraordinary film in all aspects. From the first to the last minute, I was completely glued to the development of the story. I also highlight Christian Bale and Matt Damon's excellent performances.\\nAnyway, I really recommend to everyone to see this masterpiece, I also confess that I became a big fan of car racing, especially the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\",\n",
       " \"This movie, IMO, lived up to the hype. The race scenes are nail-biting. The acting is top-notch. I'm very familiar with the Ford/Ferrari battle and the outcome of the Le Mans race. But, much like the movie Apollo 13, that didn't detract from enjoying the movie.\\nYou don't have to be a race car fan to enjoy this. In fact, I never watch car racing. The story is brilliantly told and directed. I watched a video, prior to seeing the film, that showed the special effects used to create the race scenes. What's so amazing is how realistic this movie looks. You would never know what they went through to make these race scenes.\\nBale and Damon are pure magic on screen. Jon Bernthal as Lee Iaccoca? It works! Everyone was perfectly cast. Lastly, the 2.5-hour runtime truly flies by due to the excellent pacing. You will be glued to your seat.\\nPerfection!\",\n",
       " \"Great movie! However the name is the reason why I gave it a 9 and not a 10!I've known of Carroll Shelby most of my life and to not have given this film its proper name is a crime to Mr. Shelby. A man who basically carved out the American racing scene before any of us knew about any famous american auto racers.\",\n",
       " 'Performances by Christian Bale and Josh Lucas, who REALLY pulls off the smarmy jerk well, make this film better than expected. Racing scenes are varied and well-filmed enough to keep one interested through their length.',\n",
       " \"When I was in design school, my professors always reminded me that it was much easier to do a campaign for a condom company than a fence-building company. Thanks Susan. That is true. F V F is a fence company - a movie about cars and racing cars. But, this is a great, well made, creative masterpiece. It never gets corny or starchy. Granted - some of the periphery characters are caricatures, but, the main characters on which we focus feel real and not put on.\\nIn contrast to some of the Oscar pics that seem more like rewards for towing the line rather than artistic achievements, it's good to have a movie that you can watch from start to end w/o questioning what you're watching and still get completely caught-up in it. I loved JoJo Rabbit almost as much (that took a lot from Wes Anderson - a favorite), but a good straight-forward, well written, un-cringy movie like F v F should still be an AA favorite.\",\n",
       " \"Let's get the negatives quickly out of the way. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies in this one and some play major parts in the story. But it is quite impossible to cram 5 or more years of reality, into 150 minutes of film. So, it is a pass for me.What i really didn't like though, was the racing/action scenes. There wasn't any sense of speed in them. Instead there was a lot of camera trembling, sped-up shots and cgi. That was a real let down in a film that has a car as one of the main protagonists.On the other hand the actors were all brilliant. From the main man (Damon), to the bad guy (Lucas), to the daredevil (Bale) everyone added significant parts to plot and character development.The plot was going to be good because the real story had all the ingredients for a Hollywood movie. Danger, emotion and underdog status, along with the sad story of a man capable of greatness, but always on the out of the corporate new world.And last but not least, the cars were simply fantastic. The Cobras, Mustangs and GT40s from Ford, alongside the main opposition in the Ferrari 330 P3. Majestic!\\nEven if you know the story or don't, petrolhead or not, it is a very well made film that you have to see.\",\n",
       " 'Ford v Ferrari is nearly exactly what you expect it to be. In this case, that is not a bad thing. The performances are solid, the action is exciting, the stakes are high, and there is just enough background intrigue to create a meaningful central conflict. It\\'s a crowd pleaser and a thrill ride, with appeal for just about anyone. The film never strives to be overtly political, nor does it push a strong social agenda. No, this is a movie about cars and the people who make and race them, and this is a story about American exceptionalism, akin to the space race or the miracle on ice; the difference being, the stakes are contained: Can Ford build a car that can take on Ferarri at Le Mans? And who is going to drive that beast? It\\'s an America vs Italy story; a story of \"creatives\" - doers - the racers, the mechanics, the visionaries - vs business interests - cautious, profit and image focused. Who will win in the end?',\n",
       " 'This movie has it all, a well interpreted and interesting setting, big hitters that do not disappoint, humor that fits all crowds, and an emotion Journey following a man and his obsession with pushing the limits.This is excellent film making, phenomenal set design, and I even found myself appreciating some of the lighting. The final frame of the film has a crazy artifact shadowing the confused bystander which transitions to the outro text.',\n",

       " \"You can't beat a good old racing car movie . Ever since movies began there have been films about racing . I think they are popular because it's a very uncomplicated format and it's easy for the audience to get caught up in the excitement of what's happening on screen and that's certainly the case with this movie .This is the story of American car designer Carroll Shelby and the fearless British-born driver Ken Miles , who together battled corporate interference, the laws of physics, and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford Motor Company and take on the dominating race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966.This is an incredibly enjoyable movie . It looks and sounds fantastic and the two lead performances from Damon and Bale are great .\\nI loved the side show battle with the suits at Ford . Although obviously exaggerated for dramatic effect , the interference from these corporate idiots is almost as much fun as the racing .For some stupid reason this movie has two titles . In America it's called Ford Vs Ferrari and in the rest of the world it's called Le Mans ' 66 . The director , James Mangold says it's for legal reasons but the consensus is that it was changed because most of the American public have not heard of Le Mans.\\nI find that hard to believe.\",\n",

A lot of movies these days are so cynical, which is why its refreshing to see an old school, inspirational sports movie. This movie also has great performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale.

       " \"Ford v Ferrari (5 out of 5 stars).Ford v Ferrari is an awesome sports drama film that delivered on the racing scenes that puts you right in the drivers wheel. And leaves you right on the edge. James Mangold's direction did it great with its exciting racing sequences which is loud, thrilling, and intense. The drama and story building with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are also great and gripping with its story. The script, direction, and performances are outstanding.The plot follows when Henry Ford (Tracy Letts) wants to try to make the fastest car for the 24 hours of Le Mans race in France. He has Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) try to help and rebuild a Ford GT40 and has a race car driver Ken (Christian Bale) try to test the cars and compete in the 24 hour race. Racing against Lorenzo who is racing for Ferrari.It is a long movie of 2 hours and 30 so minutes. But it goes by fast with its gripping and sharp script. The characters are great. Carroll designs cars and is unable to race from his heart condition. While Ken is a struggling mechanic, trying to support his family. He brings his son around when he is building sports cars. Ken also hates when the executives and bosses from Ford tries to tell him what to do. Which makes their relationship and partnership unstable. The script is sharp with its storytelling.The direction is moving with a building story and thrilling race sequences. The racing scenes are pedal to the metal intense. The cinematography in putting the cameras on the streets of racing cars flying by.

I want to love movies, but it's been years since I've watched one that I really loved. Then came F v F.... This movie is absolutely brilliant! From the acting to the cinematography, even the soundtrack and sound effects, everything is on point.I've always love racing, watched F1 and WRC when I was young, but didn't know much about Le Mans, let alone the story behind Ford and Shelby teaming up. The story line was captivating, the plot twists were unpredictable. The rivalry with Ferrari was palpable, yet being only a medium for a much deeper story. The paste of the movie is perfect, always leaving you wanting to know what's coming next. The dialogue is rich, the details, credible. It plunges you into the world of racing in quite a convincing manner, with technicalities and politics that doesn't overwhelm the audience. The performance of Bale and Deamon are outstanding, touching at times. You heard it, I almost cried...I don't know how factually accurate this story is, but I don't care. This movie is a masterpiece.\",\n",

Christian Bale excels his acting skills as the protagonist as a car tester/mechanic/racer. Matt Damon gives a great supporting performance. However, Jon Bernthal seems to be a wasted cast since his part where his performance matters gets peaked in the first 40 minutes. He appears to have no potential role after that. Nevertheless, watching the drama between team Ferrari and Ford unfold with sleek shining vintage beauties is a treat for eyes and ears. Cinematography, sound-mixing, screenplay, and editing is on point.\\nMy rating 7.9 🌟',\n",

       " \"I saw this only because I always see the films nominated for best picture. I don't drive and I know almost nothing about Motorsports. I still managed to be thoroughly entertained by the film. The film deftly blends a story of corporate skulduggery with the racing stuff and manages to tell human interest story about both Miles and Shelby. With so many balls in the air the editor and writers manage to keep the film straightforward and *moving.* This is one the best paced films of the year and the racing stuff is just fantastic as actions scenes.My only real problem with the film is that Beebe's animosity towards Miles is underdeveloped. They have one scene where they butt heads but it propels a lot of the tension of the story. I didn't realize how critical the butting heads scene was until after the movie was long over. It is the only part of the film that wasn't top notch.Bale is the best part. Miles is a great prickly underdog. And Bale hasn't every been this endearing in ages. The film ends up having a bittersweet ending and Bale's choices really help the ending land with emotional power. This was a very good film.\",\n",

One of the best scene ever i watched in the history of Hollywood and it is in the end of this movie when Kem miles wants to end the lap together and later discovers that he was betrayed and after knowing that he still doesn't get sad or take any action because he knows that who is the real winner and he knows that he the champion.When i saw that trailer, i had thought it would be like creation of Ferrari and Ford cars and had thought it would be race between Matt and Bale but it was totally beyond my thoughts.Climax of this movie was pretty impressive.\",\n",

       " \"Driven by a high-speed bromance between two of Hollywood's finest (Bale and Damon), Ford v Ferrari is a fantastic film both on counts of character development and racing set-pieces. The writers (the Butterworths and Jason Keller) set the film between 1963 and 1966, giving the characters of Caroll Shelby (Damon), Ken Miles (Bale), Mollie Miles (Balfe), Peter Miles (Jupe), Iacocca (Bernthal), and Henry Ford II (Letts) sufficient time, screen-space, and dialogues to be built from the ground up.Even for viewers who aren't into automobiles, Ford v Ferrari will be an enjoyable watch owing to Mangold's energetic direction and the screen chemistry between Damon and Bale. Their friendship has been written and portrayed with the kind of warmth that everyone is bound to find engaging. There are differences in tastes and opinions, but when the duo gets down to the racing business, it's all respect for each other. Shelby, a notable (former) race car driver and automotive designer, is the DRIVING FORCE and Miles, a World War II veteran is the DRIVER here. The dynamics between them are brilliant and truly a sight to see on the screen.Ford v Ferrari also succeeds in building up great supporting acts - a tongue-in-cheek Iacocca, a concerned wife in Mollie, a somewhat adorable Petey, a no-nonsense Henry Ford II, a cunning Leo Beebe, and a seething Enzo Ferrari. As much as the film is about the rivalry between the two automobile giants, it's about the drama (a.k.a the little things) too. Like, Miles having a moment with his wife and kid, Shelby contemplating his career, a funny-as-hell tussle between Shelby and Miles, and sleepless nights before the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Speaking of Le Mans, it does make sense for the viewer to have some context on this form of endurance racing to truly know what racers (in this case, Ken Miles) ought to have gone through.Ford v Ferrari has a thrilling final hour with one of the best-ever racing set-pieces to be captured on film. Mangold truly lets the cars burn the tarmac when they should, in a finale that looks every bit authentic with little to no CGI. This may also be why every crash-and-burn shot feels a lot more concerning than otherwise. There's also the scene set ten minutes before the commencement of Le Mans, with Miles walking into the arena with a teacup in hand to a packed house, Shelby next to him; the duo watch the cars being set-up, the Ferraris pass them by, Enzo's looking down at them from the stands; the tensive mood pervading the entire arena is conveyed beautifully. It's scenes like these that leave a lasting memory.This is a film that makes you want to look up more of the Le Mans if you haven't already. And that, by default, makes Ford v Ferrari a raging win in my books.\",\n",
       " 'American films tend to sing glories to the achievements of their citizens and in this case, an Englishman is involved in the ultimate success of an adventure to beat the top representative of speed and quality in car races.Undoubtedly Matt Damon and Christian Bale give their best -as usual- in their performance, but Josh Lucas as Leo Beebee happens to steal the show from them as the corrosive, hypocrite, and false villain of the narration. He becomes THE MAN ONE LOVES TO HATE and in top form, indeed.The whole atmosphere of a gripping script is enhanced with his presence and the way he shows how he can plan underground strategies to try to sink Ken Miles, but in the end -and even if he humiliates Miles- the spectator ends with a bitter flavour remembering his presence.KUDOS for such a superb piece of acting, Mr. Lucas.',\n",

The element of Ford becoming not only a contender but a winner of the Le Mans, not really a spoiler it's already down in the books, does very little in itself, however the journey and the eccentricness of the man behind the wheel who helped make it possible was the films shinning beacon. Also appreciated the short inserts of Lee Iacocca and his contribution to the Ford racing program. Ford v Ferrari puts a fresh perspective on a moment in history which most would most likely care less about, but it does it in a way which could be entertaining for a whole family. It's the classic underdog story, which that character arc which you would expect, but with an altruistic defiance to confirm and follow rules which add an almost James Dean rebel without a cause type flare to this film. All in all fun film and entertaining.\",\n",

       " \"I'm not much of a car fanatic let alone racing fanatic but the story had me intrigued enough to go see it and I was not disappointed!Ford v Ferrari tells the story of how Ford made it's first racing car with an aim to win the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans in France over Ferrari who had won the last four years. At its core however it is the story American car designer Carroll Shelby and British driver Ken Miles who made it happen and their relationship.Let's start first at where credit is due - with Christian Bale. Another terrific performance and he pretty much steals the show in his portrayal of Ken Miles. Tough to do staring alongside Matt Damon who also delivers a fantastic performance. Yet each role he takes on, Bale seems to be able to do no wrong.I also really enjoyed the scenes in the car during races and practice runs. The shots included during the 24 Hours of Le Mans race of the track seen both within the car and also of the race, were really impressive. It gave a real authenticity to what it must feel like being in one of those races, similar to how Ride Like a Girl did the same for horse racing.The film isn't a 100% reflection on actual events, as there is more to this story which I have since been learning about. DO NOT let you stop you from seeing this film! I guarantee you'll get something out of it. It might even peak your curiosity as it did mine.\",\n",
       " 'One of the contenders for the 2020 Oscars is a sympathetic film by the acclaimed director James Mangold about car racing, and which, important to note, fortunately has nothing to do with the \"Fast and Fury\" series.The title of the film was changed to \"Le Mans 66\" in most countries where it is shown outside the US, although the original name is more appropriate, because the historical facts in the film have been adjusted and amplified, in order to highlight as much as possible the rivalry between two large factories, different in every sense, and first of all in terms of conceptions and philosophies in general, when it comes to cars and the automobile industry.\\nEither way, both titles are certainly better than the original \"Go Like Hell\" when Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt were reportedly considered for potential lead roles.\\nThis is how we get a very watchable movie, with excellent chemistry between the main actors, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, that, once it starts, can easily be turn a blind eye for all its imperfections.There is no need to waste words on the details, the movie is simply fun and recommended for viewing.

       " \"Matt Damon and Christian Bale star in this 2019 drama based on true events. This takes place in the 1960's and Damon (The Martian) plays racecar driver turned designer, Carroll Shelby who works for the Ford Motor company. He tries to save the business from taking a nosedive from competing company, Ferrari by designing a new, faster Ford model with help from his mechanic friend, Ken Miles (Bale) who not only agrees, but wants to drive it as well. When the corporate execs disapprove of Miles, Shelby puts his job on the line to help his friend be the first to drive the car and win the La Mans race. This is a good bio drama with humorous, dramatic and thrilling moments, Damon & Bale are great in it and together. I recommend this.\",\n",
       " \"Christian Bale killed it in this movie. Matt Damon was great too. As a racing movie, a bit of a let down but the last race was fantastic. A real nail bitter! The title Ford V. Ferrari is misleading; it really is a story about two guys who love cars, and I really appreciated that. I really loved the family dynamic with Bale's character in this movie especially. Overall, I can see why people would give this movie a perfect score, but for me the writing just makes it fall a little short. But for a biopic, it was fantastic!\",\n",

This is definitely an exception and its a racing movie. Well, sort of a racing movie. The cast is pretty good. Matt Damon and Christian Bale kill it on their end. Its very compelling emotionally and can definitely make you empathize with the characters. Nice to see a movie that doesn't have a political message or underlying social message in 2019. You can go read the synopsis for this movie to find out what its about, but its a great movie for people that don't even like racing. The characters are predictable and the story is rather predictable as well, but it is based on a true story of which we know the outcome and the setting lends an idea of the kind of people you are going to see. This is probably one of the best movies about racing I have ever seen. You don't learn much on the historical side of things and, honestly, that is probably a good thing. If you are looking for the story without the entertainment then watch the documentary, but if you are looking for a fun and entertaining movie with badass cars, then, this movie is for you. Btw, this movie is visually striking and shot very well.\",\n",

It did this while maintaining a careful view of its priorities, it wasnt there to tell you what the 60's were but to use it as a backdrop for a real story.The acting was superb throughout, Damon really gave a strong performance and Bale really managed to convey well the good and bad character traits with real respect for the person he was representing. Also, although Caitriona Balfe was playing a supporting role I think her performance really needs to be called out. Caitriona managed to portray real strength and respect in a female character, she never went around screaming she was better than men, she instead portrayed real emotions, real reactions and genuine heart. I felt her supporting role was very well done too.Overall this felt like a movie which had some respect for its audiences intelligence and managed to really provide both genuine escapism and tell a very interesting and engaging story. Highly recommended viewing.\",\n",

Few of us are able to embrace that chance to become the best versions of ourselves and set benchmarks for generations to follow. This movie celebrates that spirit of pursuit of perfection at one's craft both individually and as a team.Caroll Shelby & Phil Remington built and Ken Miles raced the Ford Shelby GT 40 which defeated the most brilliantly engineered cars at the time - The Ferrari in the most demanding and enduring race in the world - 24 hours of LeMans in 1966 and it went on to win for 4 consecutive years. And to date, it remains the only American car to do so.Yes, the movie has all the adrenaline pumping, engine revving, nail-biting action that we expect from a race car movie. But it goes much beyond that by bringing out the amazing comradery and personal journeys of Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles. It shows how a small team of committed and talented people who set themselves an impossible target can actually make God (Ferrari) bleed by sheer will power, raw talent, and good old hard work. It also beautifully shows how family believes in you when others give up.Christian Bale and Matt Damon are impeccable.Visuals are awesome, all real cars, real drivers, shot from the perspective of the driver - Behind the wheel and on the track.

Though the many scenes of fast driving do add some adrenaline, the film has to rely on a dramatic arc that hinges on the possibility of building a fast car and getting the right driver. Unfortunately this dilemma advances all too predictably, and features static characters in cookie-cutter relationships that feature no real tension and no development whatsoever. The characters are drawn well enough to elicit a few laughs at unexpected juxtapositions, but mostly they just go through the motions, and we literally hear the same overblown lines at the end of the film as we do at the beginning, as though the film wanted to remind viewers that nothing actually happens in between. Some nice period touches and decent turns by some supporting actors working with limited material demonstrate that the filmmakers were at least trying, but the flat relationships and tepid dialog keep things moving at a snooze. Maybe watch it on an airplane if there's nothing better?\",\n",

       " \"Ford v Ferrari just adds to the growing list of amazing films to come out in 2019, it delivers one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen, the film is 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like that at all because of how exciting and engaging the film is. James Mangold has proved that he is a seriously underrated director and needs to be considered as one of the best working today. The cast is fantastic especially Christian Bale who should be in Oscar talks this year. He delivered what I believed was the best performance last year in Vice and he once again gives such an amazing performance alongside Matt Damon who is also awesome in the film.The film also explores dynamics such as: A father son relationship and being proud of who you are as a person which were really poignant. The sound mixing and editing is Oscar worthy with the cars sounding so awesome. It also explores all the aspects to racing that are rarely explored in film such as: The strategy behind winning the race, finding the right driver for the car, the business behind the racing and all the politics that are associated with it.The only nitpicky thing I could find is that some audiences may find the beginning to be a little slow and would like 5-10 mins cut out from the film so that it is a tighter package however it didn't really bother me at all.Overall Ford v Ferrari treats its subject matter with care, the film has great direction, fantastic acting and explores such interesting themes that I think it transcends the genre so people who aren't even fans of cars and racing will still love this film.\",\n",

The in the driver's seat point of view makes the races exciting and the David v Goliath thing always gets you rooting for the underdog. Enjoyable even for non race car enthusiasts. The actors are good from main to supporting. Bale is convincing as the driver. Damon looks suitably tired and puffy as the ex driver turned designer.Some faults - Some scenes could have been cut. The wife's hissy fit could have been cut. Josh Lucas' mini nasty character was over done for the sake of having a villain, Jez Butterworth the screen writer wrote plays that have made it to Broadway and are excruciatingly and unnecessarily long.

Apart from that - the performances were likely the highlight in the otherwise underwhelming film.Another issue is that at least in other sports films there\\'s a clearer, unifying theme to the movie. This film felt confused at times. Was Ford\\'s bureaucracy a detriment or a strength? It flipped on a dime between what seemed like demonizing and congratulating Ford. Was it about friendship?

       " \"The challenge of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which gets reduced to an unparsimonious Two Hours and 32 Minutes of Le Movie, is that you have to go fast, really fast, as fast as you can and for 24 hours on an uneven, treacherous track, sometimes at night, sometimes in the rain, all while not destroying the automobile itself, and also not the drivers. Occasionally, you become One with Le Car, somewhere right around 7,000rpm, and you either ascend into pure energy, or you blow a rod shifting into a bonus gear.There are a few chances for Ford v Ferrari to be a more socially meaningful film, maybe more openings for more clever statements about the stuffiness of businessmen and suited executives versus the life-loving, individualistic visionaries who make the businessmen jealous because they do not have the creativity or talent to do much beyond monetizing other people's excellences. On the other hand, the movie does a good job of instilling the adrenaline rush of setting new lap records, none of which feels very safe.If we all were to make a list of stuff to do for exactly 24 hours, speed racing is not likely to appear on many of our lists.

So F v F is the true story of how Ford established a name in racing over a feud with Ferrari while also being a Ken Miles biopic , and James Mangold does both like a master and knocks it out of the park. Christian bale got down to his og English accent and absolutely kills it as Ken Miles with his method acting , Matt Damon too was really good as Carrol Shelby and so were the rest of the cast . The story is an underdog tale about Ford , a company which makes cars for the common man , teaming up with former racer Shelby and his Man behind the wheel , Ken Miles. None of their pasts are revealed or even hinted at and yet you care for these characters , the movie makes you realise that by throwing in a will he die / won't he die based on reaching the rpm limit throughout the entire second act . Also , this movie is masterfully shot by Phedon Papamichael known for walk the line and Ides of March and he makes every frame look gorgeous , which is aided by sleek editing , music and sound design. In the end , Ford v Ferrari is a well directed , masterfully shot , brilliantly acted biopic with neat dialogue , powerful characters , passion towards a goal , a rush of adrenaline , one chameleon called Christian Bale and Ford's marketing strategy ironically said through tons and tons of coca cola product placement.\",\n",

       " \"First Hit: I love good car movies, and this one qualifies as one of the best.It's been a while since I've been to a night showing of a film. In picking this evening time and this film, it was both pleasing and irritating to be in a nearly full theater. The fun part is that I often see films where there are less than 15 people in the theater, and seeing an almost full theater gave me hope that others will continue to support going to movie theaters.The irritation part is the noise that people make during the film presentation. Why someone thinks their remembrances of the period, or what they think about what their seeing on the screen is essential to spout out while the film is playing, is beyond me. The gentleman sitting next to me turned around just as I did the same thing and together we asked them to be quiet. It took us doing this twice for them to get that they weren't at home watching cable TV.\\nDespite the noise interruptions, this film unfolded in a fun way. Remembrances of the 1960s abounded with cars from the era on the streets. Yes, they were perfectly restored vehicles, but it was easy to gloss over the prettiness to enjoy the beauty of those old cars reflecting their time and place in my life. There were Shelby Cobras, Porsches, Ford Falcons, Mini, woody (fake wood) wagons, Ferraris, and Ford GT 40s.The film is about how Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) turned down Henry Ford II's (Tracy Letts) offer to buy 90% of Ferrari's car production company. In turning down Ford's offer and partnering with Fiat, Enzo made unflattering remarks about Ford and his cars to the Ford negotiation team. Angered by the personal comments, Ford vowed to beat perennial 24 Hours Le Mans race winner, Ferrari.Chief Ford negotiator, Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), was then tasked with finding a car builder who will build a Ford-based car to beat Ferrari. Finding Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), the one-time winning driver of the 24 Le Mans, to make the car, Ford believes they found their man. Henry Ford gives Shelby carte blanche to build this car.Shelby, in turn, hires his friend and race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), to be his test driver and co-builder. The main reason is that he can trust Miles as he knows cars and feels their abilities and problems as he drives them. Miles is also creative when figuring out how to make cars work better. The downside of Miles is that he's a maverick in his thinking and hates to conform to rules and being told what to do.Miles is married Mollie (Caitriona Balfe), who's amused by her husband's friendship with Shelby. There are couple scenes that this loving amusement shows up. One thing the film makes clear is that Ken is a loving devoted father who loved showing his son Peter (Noah Jupe) the ins and outs of racing.The film spends time showing Miles and Shelby developing the GT40 to race in Le Mans, but when it comes time to ship the car off to the race, Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) Senior VP at Ford, chooses another driver to drive the vehicle at the Le Mans race.Shelby is pissed, Miles is severely disappointed, and of course, the new driver doesn't feel the car like Miles would have and ends up blowing it apart during the race.Ford wants to fire Shelby for the failure, but the meeting between Ford and Shelby is fantastic because Shelby convinces Ford that he, Ford, has Ferrari where he wants him, scared. Scared because Shelby's car, with another driver, was faster than the Ferrari, especially on the straightaway at Le Mans. This was a great scene. It's reflecting Shelby's legendary ability to sell anyone on anything.Ford tells Shelby to fix the car and get it ready for the next Le Mans and that Shelby has control over the driver.The rest of the movie shows how they develop a stronger, lighter, faster GT40 car. But when Beebe intercedes again about Miles being the driver at Le Mans, Shelby takes Ford out in the GT40 and scares the crap out of him, literally.\\nThen at that moment negotiates with Ford to let Miles drive. As part of the deal he offers Ford his Shelby American company if Miles races and loses.It's scenes like this that are fun to watch and reminded me of the time that a friend of a friend, gave me a ride in a Lamborghini Miura, and scared the crap out of me while racing around a sizeable empty factory parking lot at a very high speed.There were sections of this 152-minute film that could have been trimmed, but I was engaged enough to not care about the lulls of uninteresting or engaging material. Other characters added to this story and made better. One such person was Chief Mechanic Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon). His ideas about creating a way to change the brake assembly were brilliant.Bale was intensely and independently outstanding in this role as race car driver Ken Miles. His ability to show tenderness and love towards his family and aggressively focused on making the car faster was terrific. Damon was wonderful as Carroll Shelby. The scene with Ford after the first loss and his fight with Miles in front of Mile's home reflected the off-told stories about the legend of Carroll Shelby. Bernthal was good as the famed Iacocca. Balfe was convincing as Ken's wife. Her support and understanding of her husband were excellently portrayed. My favorite scene shows Balfe driving Ken home while pressing him on his whereabouts. Her focused intensity was sublime. Letts was priceless as Ford II. The bullying ways he used around his staff and factory followed by his being humbled by the spin in the GT40 were terrific. McKinnon was excellent as devoted Chief Mechanic for Shelby. Beebe was appropriately arrogant, self-serving, and sharp as a foil to Shelby's vision. Girone was satisfyingly perfect as Enzo Ferrari. Jez and John-Henry Butterworth wrote an expansive script that could have been shortened and made crisper. However, there are some outstanding scenes in the film. James Mangold directed this film. To his credit, racing scenes can get old quick, but the excellent editing and cinematography made these scenes come alive.Overall: I liked seeing this film for multiple reasons, including that the subsequent Ford built Shelby Mustang GT-350 and GT-500 had parts made by my father's company in the late 1960s.\",\n",
       " 'The director of the film James Mangold himself claims in interviews that he shot \\'Saving Private Ryan\\' in the reverse, a film that unfolds gradually, and in the third act shows all its beauty, in a monumental scene portraying the course of the great and one of the toughest car races in the world - Le Mans, during which racers drove all day and night.At first, however, I would like to briefly address the loud and polarizing opinions about this film that have already appeared.\\nSo the ultra-left side (swjs) already thinks that this movie is a step backwards, because it focuses on the friendship of two white men and generally it is a movie packed with alpha men fighting for power. Of course, this is unfair simplification and not true.This film tells a classic story of David vs Goliath, a story of beautiful friendship between two passionate people. On the surface this is a film about a duel between Ford and Ferrari in Le Mans, but if we dive deeper, it is truly a story about eternal struggle between corporation and artists (which can also be transferred to the film industry itself).Therefore, people should forget about politics at least once, especially if we are in the world of art, cinema, film, because pushing politics into everything becomes really devastating and toxic, art / films are given contexts that simply do not exist in these specific cases. Ford and Ferrari is a nostalgic return to the old cinema, yes, it talks mainly about men, but also about their passion, family and love. About small- big things that are simple and present in everyone\\'s life, it is a film for everyone.Other opinions that I heard are that the whole story is too simple and predictable, and the characters are not shown enough off the race track, too little character study. First of all, the allegation about the simplicity of this story is absurd, because the director clearly wanted to make such a film - it\\'s not just a car film, but a classic western as the director himself confirmed in an interview for The Times : \\'\\'As much as I felt like I was making a race movie, I was making Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a movie about friendship \" - he said. And it\\'s true.This film ticks off every known point in the classic western story, in which you can find a duel between the good and the bad, fight between the charming \\'outlaw\\' poets of the wheel and the great, bad, big bosses of something much bigger. Perhaps, as some say, Mangold\\'s mistake was focusing too much on the conflict of bureaucracy - the racetrack, but as I read in interviews, the script was re-written several times, it was supposed to be an old classic cinema about male friendship and hardships and it works. And yes - from time to time, we need to take a break from the over-intellectualised and psychologically intense cinema and we simply need such pure entertainment, with a dose of pathos, emotions, great collective scenes and two very pleasant acting performances.And now back to these two main characters. Bale and Damon play two geniuses, one of whom can communicate with the rest of the world like a normal human and belong to a larger community (Damon\\'s Shelby) and the other (Bale\\'s Miles), is a total freak, an outsider incompatible with anyone and anything except maybe his wife and son, exuberant eccentric. But it is exactly this \\'\\' separateness \\'\\', internal life, loneliness and quirks of Miles, that can lead to the defeat of the invincible Ferrari. These two make the film from beginning to end and the chemistry between them is great. The duo dynamics provide us with a few really hilarious scenes, one of which deserves special attention - the fight scene near Miles\\'s home. Bale and Damon are excellent comedy-wise in this scene, as middle-aged daddies pathetically trying to knock each other down with bread or a trash can lid.For me, these two performances deserve recognition, because Damon and Bale did what they could with the script they got. They both did a lot of work.However, if I had to choose one, I would choose Bale. Bale plays Ken Miles, the maverick British racing driver really brilliantly. His energy, the entire digging into the psychology of the character, but also into his physicality - Christian is a master of total acting. Pay attention to the work of his arms at the cinema - just like Miles, and yet there are so few video clips with Miles. Bale\\'s acting is not at all \\'too big\\', Miles is just like that in this movie - explosive, impulsive, full of passion, but also has a tart language without a filter for those who want to manipulate him. Also, let\\'s not forget that Bale spoke personally to Miles\\'s son Peter, as he prepared for the role.Miles was a bona-fide eccentric, and his cockpit monologues have something of Top Gear about them.\"Learn to drive, you pillock!\" he roars as someone cuts him up. \"More of that please, giddy up!\" he shouts when the car responds. \"This feels like a bag of squirrels!\" he yells when it doesn\\'t. Miles was from Birmingham, but Bale\\'s version has more than a touch of Yorkshire. He is basically an unholy hybrid of Jeremy Clarkson, Alan Partridge and Geoffrey Boycott.\"Christian had this remarkable list of Brummie expressions he made on a wadded-up piece of notepaper\" Mangold said in The Times interview \"I\\'d like to frame it. People said that Miles liked to talk to himself while he was driving and we hadn\\'t really written any ongoing mutterings for him. So between takes when he was in the car, Christian had this piece of paper: \\'Your face is redder than a spiked arse . . . let\\'s not go round the Wrekin (Black Country slang for going the long way).\\' \" I find this anecdote hilarious.According to the director, double-decker rigs allowed Bale and co to be filmed in the cars while they were driven by professional drivers sitting on the roof. \"So the actors are moving through space at 100 miles an hour, they\\'re amid other traffic all being driven by pros, but they\\'re allowed to act, remember their lines, take notes.\" Or, in Bale\\'s case, swear like a trooper.Bale\\'s character is certainly, heightened (but as I wrote this is Miles in this story) hurling wrenches as freely as he chucks insults. Mangold thinks the performance expresses \"a lot of the joy in Christian\\'s soul. So many of his roles, in a very direct contradiction of who he is in life, are just very grim. The playfulness rarely gets a chance to shine.\"With Phoenix, as with Bale and Daniel Day Lewis, \"you\\'re not even sure where the acting stops\", Mangold said. \"There\\'s a kind of danger.\\'\\' and he added : \\'\\'Matt, Christian, Joaquin, Russell Crowe, Vanessa Redgrave, Robert De Niro: they come to the set to play. They\\'re the opposite of tricky - they want to be directed and they\\'ve worked with many great directors, so they have a great deal of trust.\\'\\'And for all these reasons, for me Christian Bale is actually the most fascinating actor in today\\'s film world. He is the most unique and unpredictable actor of modern actors. He always turns left when everyone else turns right, and vice versa - goes straight when the others turn. His choices are quite unusual, they never go with fashion, with mainstream.In the previous year, he played without hesitation in the very polarizing \\'\\' Vice \\'\\' and there is no doubt that he angered many on the right side of the political scene, and today he plays in an old-fashioned western - sport film about purely male friendship, which, as I can see, has already annoyed some feminists and ultra-leftists.But Christian only goes his own ways, just like Ken Miles, and chooses roles that challenge him, not because of political correctness. As he has shown more than once, he does not care who he can anger with his dark, witty, sardonic and self-deprecating sense of humor (you can see it in many interviews) and I absolutely love it.Finally, that\\'s why Christian is a brilliant actor, one of a kind, but also a chameleon - because I\\'ve read thousands of comments online about him and no one actually has a clue. But James Mangold, who is friends with Bale, gave a great IndieWire interview about the film and Bale, one great quote: \\'\\' I felt the role was close to Bale and prayed he would do it. He\\'s a model to me of artistic perseverance and flexibility. He\\'ll text you with thoughts and free associations about the character. It\\'s all incredible food. He\\'s a wonderful father, loving husband, great friend. He\\'s not interested in being famous. He drives a pickup truck, he\\'s grounded in the world, he raced motorcycles but had to stop when he got hurt, when he had kids. There are so many parts of Ken in Christian, who\\'s a perfectionist. He\\'s trying to achieve something for himself. It\\'s magical to direct someone like that because they draw you into their own idealism. You feel that energy; it permeates the set\\'\\'.Like Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood, Le Mans \\'66 is about \"the transition moment for men in the Sixties as the world is changing from underneath them\", Mangold says. With their nonchalant machismo and hands-on practicality, Miles and Shelby are an endangered species, as Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s and Brad Pitt\\'s characters were in Quentin Tarantino\\'s movie. Mangold seems a bit like that too. Not a dinosaur, but one of those muscular all-rounders who would have thrived in the golden age of Tinseltown.He smiles. \"I\\'d be very happy 50 years ago, in the Hollywood system.\" He says he\\'s trapped, but he has always been \"a wanderer in terms of genre\", from cops to cowboys, asylum inmates to country singers, superhero pensioners to retro racers. He thinks his versatility has been \"almost to his detriment\". Nonsense. Mangold is just that quaint, old-fashioned thing: a really good director.Let this be the ultimate encouragement. Ford vs Ferrari is an epic, old-fashioned cinema, no CGI, they had car replicas, for that reason only it\\'s worth watching in the cinema, on a big screen.',\n",
       " \"The plot is given straight away with Henry Ford II insulted by Ferrari and vowing to win the Le Mans race by building a race car. But what makes this movie amazing is the narrative and performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale that makes you feel you are in the driver seat. The scenes where the culture at Ford affects the innovation and Shellby's pitch to put Ken Miles behind the wheels are wonderful and makes the movie realistic.

Childish arguments repeating throughout remind me of the 1968 Elvis movie Speedway more than a story depicting greats like Carol Shelby and Henry Ford 2. Having said that is is structured so that once you are sitting there watching you want to see the outcome, even though you know how it ends. There must have been 20 minutes wasted looking at the side of Christian Bales head while driving, with a competitor in the background moving back and forward in an unrealistic manner. The Butterworth boys would have done well to actually go to a race track and watch at least one car race. How many minutes watching a foot on a brake pedal and accelarator do we need to waste ? Surprisingly one of my friends has been to this movie 4 times, but he is a car guy, not a movie buff. It will appeal to Donald Trump voters I suspect.',\n",

       " \"Fast and Furious, no not the movie, the two words that best describe James Mangolds newest project, Ford V Ferrari. On the outside, Ford V Ferrari may seem like your run of the mill racing movie with a simple plot, but after watching you realize that it is much more than that. You see obsession, tension, and an overarching rivalry between The Ford Motorcompany and Ferrari. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), shows a compulsive behavior that radiates to those around him, he feels a need to win. For a chance at winning the 1966 24 Hours at Le Mans, Ford recruits Carol Shelby (Matt Damon), who then brings in Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as his faithful driver that has a bad rap in the racing scene but most importantly he can drive, and he can win. Starting out racing smaller circuits, Miles is afraid his racing career won't lead to success, and with a wife and a son, he is pressured to put down racing all together. This is until he is approached by Shelby about the plan Ford has to tarnish Ferrari's successful reputation in Le Mans.\\nThroughout the movie, Miles has a hostile relationship with Ford and its head executives. Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) doesn't see Miles as being the face of Fords racing team. Miles and Shelby are constantly fighting with Henry Ford II and his team of executives to try to gain the freedom to create what they want. Shelby's outside the box thinking mixed with Miles' self centered attitude show how much they can influence a big brand, even if everyone is against them. Fords financial problems mixed with jabs taken at Henry Ford II by Enzo Ferrari encourages Ford to give Shelby the keys Fords new racing team.\\nDamon's cool southern composure and Bales witty thinking create a perfect chemistry that is hard to recreate. Although the team may fight, sometimes literally, they always seem to show respect and understanding for each other. Shelby, from the beginning, sees something in Miles and he can tell Miles will be the best driver for Ford. After getting the offer to race for Ford by Shelby, Miles quickly gets to work developing the famed GT40 race car, the only American made car to win the 24 Hours at Le Mans to this day.\\nMangolds vision and execution in this movie perfectly encapsulates the golden age of racing. A time when teams did anything they could to win, when innovation was new and ideas were fresh. Everything from the sound design and visual effects to the pace of the movie flawlessly fuse together to keep you involved and interested. Everyone from gearheads that know every dimension of every part of the cars used in the movie, to those who have never thought to change their oil will be satisfied with this movie. Along with the cars, you also get to see relationships grow, watch hard times get resolved with hard work, and challenges get over come with persistence, making this a great all-around movie.\",\n",
       " \"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Although it's a long movie my attention was captivated for the entire length of the film. Damon and Bale both delivered an Oscar worthy performance and they truly made the audience feel as though they were really there.\",\n",

Bale and Damon are spot on , though it's hard for me to decide which one turned in the best performance, because, as of this writing, Bale has locked the Golden Globe and SAG nominations. The rest of the cast just added to the incredible story of Ford taking on Ferrari at the 24 Hours of LeMans.\\nFor racing enthusiasts, this is pure adrenaline, several scenes during the race sequences that made me jump back in my seat. Phedon Papamichael's cinematography is amazing. There is a scene where Miles (Bale) takes his son out to the LAX runway and explains to him the perfect lap. It was such a touching scene (it plays later in the movie) because of the way Papamichael lit it. It sent chills down my back.\\nIn conclusion, a must see film for anyone, racing enthusiast or not.

       " \"(Flash Review)All cinematic facets were hitting on all cylinders. Ferrari had been winning the 24 Hour of Le Man's race again and again and again. Enzo Ferrari rejected Ford's offer to merge companies which angered Henry Ford II and he decided to challenge Ferrari's Le Mans dominance by building a better racecar. Carrol Shelby was put in charge of building and designing the car and racing program with the help of Ken Miles as driver/engineer. Watch as they battle it out on track and in the garage. Can the American behemoth snatch victory from the innovative Ferrari? This film nailed the engine and racing sounds and had very good racing effects although I feel Rush was a bit better. Complimenting that with deep character emotions made for a well-rounded film. Christian Bale was dialed in as quirky and unrefined Ken Miles, which the film emotionally hinged around, and Damon was pure Matt Damon and able to tease out genuine feelings; enough that a tear was shed. Even the supporting characters had genuine emotional moments. All in all, this was top notch with a briskly paced story.\",\n",
       " 'Christian Bale gives an outstanding preformance as Ken Miles in this movie. He really portrays the character credibly.

Second, because from the start I was expected to root for Ford, when in all sporting events involving an American team and a non-American team, I always root for the latter as a point of principle.\\nI'm glad I stuck it out, as the film had me sold almost from the start. How true or accurate it is, I neither know nor care, as I was totally involved in the story. Yes there are cliched elements (the interfering company executives etc), and there were rather more dramatic gear-changes than we really needed - but the film revolves around two terrific performances from Matt Damon and, particularly, Christian Bale as a man who not only lives and breathes motor-oil, but regularly showers in the stuff as well.\\nPetrolheads will love it.

I say this because I got a legitimate rush out of this movie and when Ford is battling Ferrari I find myself wanting to get up and cheer them on.Furthermore, Bale and Damon should be in more movies together. The chemistry and the performances they deliver are exceptional. That\\'s not to say the rest of the cast isn\\'t pulling their weight, there are good, convincing performances all around, which does wonders for the immersion into this story.Also aiding in the immersion is the cinematography. Auto racing bores me in the real world and yet while watching this movie I found myself gripping the arm rests around the hairpin turns. As far as I\\'m concerned, that\\'s an achievement of this movie, that it really draws me into what\\'s going on.The only real drawback is in the \"villain\" who, at times is just extra awful.

It brings together luminaries of the time like Enzo Ferrari, Henry Ford and Carroll Shelby in a fascinating true historical event. We also learn of a name that should be honored in like, namely Ken Miles. The movie has great characters, action, suspense and an amazing ending.For me, one of the coolest scenes in the movie is when Henry Ford II takes a ride with Shelby in the GT race car.

The film combines some of the best racing ever seen on screen with the best of buddy adventures.It is now my favorite (I previously favored Steve McQueen\\'s Le Mans), reminding me of a great Western mixed with a great duo, such as Paul Newman and Robert Redford from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. There\\'s even a scene of the two heroes facing off the suits like a Western gunfight about to happen.Matt Damon as Shelby is at his best cajoling Christian Bale, consummate actor, as legendary driver Ken Miles.

Right away you get to know the characters and they're not so generic as I thought they would be. Christian Bale was the best part of this film, and his performance is very compelling. It feels totally separate from what he was in the Dark Knight and American Psycho.As time passes, the stakes get much higher. There are always barriers added along the way, whether it's the dangerous conditions of racing or the people involved in it.

If I have maybe 2 flaws, I wish some sympathy could have been put on Ferrari, as they seem like the stereotypical \"bad guy\" in the movie, and the 2nd half-hour does drag just smidge.

       " \"Released in the U.K. and other markets under the far better title, Le Mans '66, Ford v Ferrari is an exhilarating biopic telling of Ford's attempts to challenge and outdo the beloved cars of genius Enzo Ferrari in the world famous French 24 hour motor marathon.Seeking the prestige of the Ferrari badge, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), is humiliatingly rebuffed in his attempt to buy a controlling interest in the Italian motor manufacturer. In a fit of pique, he orders his executives to create a car that can turn the tables on Ferrari. Retired racing car driver now designer, Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), is engaged by Ford executive Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) to do just that. Shelby in turn recruits the cantankerously bloody-minded British racing driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to put his foot to the floor and hopefully secure the chequered flag. The project is to be overseen by Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).The film is centred on the dynamic between Shelby and Miles, their awkward relationship and history of confrontation ameliorating as they are both driven, no pun intended, to achieve victory. Their efforts are constantly frustrated by the unhelpful and self-serving Leo Beebe following his own agenda.Direction from James Mangold (Walk the Line) and cinematography from Phedon Papamichael are both first rate. The racing scenes are truly immersive and you smell the octane. Screenplay from the British pair Jez and John-Henry Butterworth with American Jason Keller, never gets bogged down in technical detail, it simply allows the story to flow, a story so engaging that the running time of two and a half hours never flags; it's not just for petrol heads. And it says much of Matt Damon's progression as a film actor that he easily holds his own in his many scenes with Christian Bale. Irish actor Caitriona Balfe as Miles's wife Mollie provides a strong foil to her husband's headstrong ways.Is the film slightly formulaic with stock characters? Maybe so, perhaps. Henry Ford II is shown as a bombastic bully, Leo Beebe an unctuous Uriah Heep-style sycophant. But when all other aspects of a film come together, who cares? Besides, most people love pantomime villains. And whether unwittingly or not, the film shows that maverick genius needs the boring business acumen and the politics inevitably attached to succeed. Both Shelby and particularly Miles are shown as pretty hopeless in their business dealings, neither would've got a car anywhere near Le Mans without the bean counters from Ford. The film is also mercifully free of modern day political analogies, concentrating instead on telling its tale without distraction.I have a feeling this film will become a perennial public holiday favourite.4.5*\",\n",

His performance should keep rubes occupied, thinking they have witnessed something genuine, an example of what acting is supposed to be.Moving on to the story. Naturally, much of this didn't happen. The pitting of big corporatist Ford Motors against Miles the humble car racer was all made up and I guessed it while watching the film - they just put these cliches in knowing that millions of not so bright members of the public will never get tired how many thousands of times they have experienced these tropes. Anything to get people punching their fists in the air and rooting for their hero. Read the facts of the Miles story if you care at all.The only real recommendable parts of the film and the reason I bothered seeing it, were the racing scenes which are thrilling. The rest, acting, plot are still somewhere on the starting line.\",\n",

This movie is all about Ford and the struggle of creating GT40. All the conflict and drama awaits you in the Ford section. Ferrari name is like a clickbait in lame internet portals: \"You won\\'t believe what Enzo Ferrari said when Henry Ford tried to buy Ferrari\" :PWe literally see almost nothing from the Ferrari side. Well, I don\\'t blame them for this cheap hoax because firstly I know from my very own experience that no one grew up with dreams of owning a Ford. We dreamed of Ferrari. Far fewer people would watch this movie if only the Ford name was mentioned in the title.Leaving this \"title nonsense\" behind, I can confidently say that two of my favorite actors Damon and Bale have both presented decent but slightly poor performance compared to their average. Plot is weak and painfully predictible even if you haven\\'t heard of a machine called \"car\" before. In addition to that, unnecessary length gave me this crazy idea that if I would cut this movie into 3 second long pieces and reunite them in the order of 1-3-5-7 and 2-4-6-8, I would probably have 2 half length, almost identical movies without losing full version\\'s essence. That would be my director\\'s cut I guess. Long story short, you won\\'t miss much if you don\\'t watch it but if you like this specific genre, it wouldn\\'t hurt to spare 2,5 hours of your time.

This is the story of how Ford Motor Company took on Ferrari in 1966 and won, with the help of automotive designer Carroll Shelby and race driver Ken Miles. The Ford team constructed the formidable GT40 which emerged victorious at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Those who were previously unaware or oblivious of this juicy bit of history will find themselves captivated by its reenactment on celluloid. The film runs two and a half hours, yet it does not drag, thanks to a tight script and solid performances, superbly-edited racing sequences along with a music score that enhances the action onscreen. Matt Damon once again proves why he is one of the finest actors of his generation; he is absolutely spot-on in his portrayal of Shelby as a man with passion, confidence and determination. I love watching him in movies like this one and also Invictus. Christian Bale's performance as Ken Miles, while a little more mannered, still manages to beautifully capture the character's extremes of tenderness and cockiness. Also noteworthy is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II; he shows that the magnate can have a commanding presence yet break down upon experiencing an epiphany. Ford v Ferrari brings a nugget of racing history to life through this well-assembled movie which is worth catching especially on the big screen.\",\n",

They nailed their character perfectly without any flaws.The action sequence was great and perfectly shot. No CGI,no shaky cam, and not messy cut. That's what I can describe for the racing scene.

As a person who likes cars and has a passing familiarity with Le Mans and car mechanics, I thought this move was excellent for people who only had a surface level knowledge of these things and had plenty for every type of movie goer.Damon and Bale are obviously excellent, with Bale donning a proper English accent and lots of eccentricity and Damon pulling off the forced retired racer and now car designer smoothly. The supporting cast was extremely well done, with special call outs to Tracy Letts, who played an absolutely excellent Henry Ford II and had one of the best scenes in the entire movie. His ability to display such a wide range of emotions really sold the audience to how invested he was in this character. Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, Bale's character's wife, was also excellent. She has a few of her own scenes where she steals the show and is the perfect compliment to Bale's character's own ad hoc lifestyle at times.In fact, most of the scenes involving Ford Execs were so good that they warrant their own biopic with their own characters. The political battle between Ford's VPs was interesting and infuriating at the same time, showing repeatidly that they are their own worst enemy.In terms of direction, this movie was executed well. Conscious decisions were made to have Italian dialogue not translated in certain scenes, allowing the audience really understand visually the scenes without giving it away. Most shots are very clean and the driving sections are well done to build tension while also not becoming boring.The movie does throw a lot of you in terms of details, mentions of gearboxes, lift, brake roters, tire swaps, etc... all show that a proper gear head would enjoy the jargon. The Ford GT40 in general really shines here and takes center stage multiple times in the film. There is one particular scene where Damon's character take the car for a spin and you really do understand the absolute power behind the car and its eventual final designs that lead it to be successful.At over 2.5 hours, this movie does not leave anything out and truly does tell the compelling story of the Americans at Le Mans. Overall the movie comes well recommend and is definitely worth a watch.\",\n",

       " 'Let me preface this by saying that I am quite a car guy. Not the type whose entire life revolves around cars, but I own a sports car and enjoy the odd track day. This means suspending my disbelief in a car movie is always a hard thing...... but this movie certainly doesn\\'t make it easy! For a car-movie aimed at car people, it was strange to find it packed with inaccuracies and car cliches. The idea that a car explodes whenever it rolls or makes contact with a hard object had finally died in most of Hollywood\\'s mainstream products. Why bring it back in a car-movie?Here are a few others:\\n-Ken\\'s car seems to be so fast that he can catch up from with everybody whenever he decides to. Why isn\\'t he winning in the first place?\\n-There\\'s this cliche that racers can overtake each other in a straight line by deciding to press the throttle harder. Again, why aren\\'t they already doing that?\\n-Brake fade and braking points obviously don\\'t happen that way, and swapping out a knuckle assembly to cool the brakes is like buying a new phone because the home button is dead (oh wait...). Ford did come up with a quick brake-change solution (which almost every new car uses), but it looked nothing like this.\\n-the 7000rpm ramble present from the opening lines of the movie (and the movie\\'s overall interpretation of RPM) is rather detached from reality. Different engine architectures behave differently at different RPMs, trying to pin that on a single value is strange and unneeded\\n-Sorry but car guys would never use \"her\" to refer to their automobile! It\\'s not a ship!With that out of the way, on to the movie stuff:\\n-the writing team tries very hard to make the story overly dramatic, by utilizing lazy writing tricks (the Daytona bet, for example), which really shouldn\\'t be necessary considering how fascinating the base story already is\\n-Christian Bale is a very good actor, but he really overdoes the Ken Miles character. There is close to no footage of the actual guy, so he had the opportunity to build whatever character and mimics he felt like. Why he chose to go so incredibly over the top (both in accentuation and behavior) is beyond me\\n-There\\'s a lot of CG going on during the races. Quite a lot. It is not badly executed, but was it really necessary? There are historic races at Le Mans they could have taken footage from rather than leave us in the uncanny valleyIt\\'s not all bad though. The story\\'s a highly interesting one, and Matt Damon\\'s performance is very good. His relationship with Ken Miles is touching, and having them compete against their own headquarters makes for a great double-sided challenge. And while the production\\'s runtime is on the longer side of things, it never feels so.To sum things up, it is a more than decent movie (hence the 7/10 rating), and probably does a great job at translating what car racing feels like to people who aren\\'t into it or know little about it (my wife had a really good time and enjoyed the movie\\'s constant suspense, as well as its visuals and performances, so it\\'s got to be doing something right!).

I do love Christian Bale and Matt Damon as actors, and the technological prowess on display was impressive (sound, editing, CGI, etc.), so I am still glad I saw it.

Ken describes the experience of being one with his racing car: \"Everything slows down\". Ken says introspectively, \"You see everything.\" That\\'s the freedom and joy of doing what you love.Director James Mangold\\'s \"Ford v Ferrari\" tells the story of Ford Motor Company\\'s challenge of Ferrari in the legendary 24-hours race at Le Mans in 1966. Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the American car designer, who Henry Ford II, played by believable Tracy Letts, asks to engineer a car to beat Ferrari at Le Mans. Carroll\\'s volatile friend and elite driver is Ken.Carroll was the only American to ever win at Le Mans. But that was the glorious past. Presently, Carroll has a failing heart valve. His racing days are history. Now, he\\'s the very successful businessmen, selling his designer cars to dudes, who don\\'t appreciate his art, his love.In the movie\\'s opening narration, Carroll describes driving his car at 7000 rpms. He\\'s in the zone. His epiphany, \"The only question that really matters: Who are you?\" As much as \"Ford v Ferrari\" is about the landmark automotive racing milestone, I was touched most by the story by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller in its poignant look at what we love, what is that meaningful to us.Christian Bale and Matt Damon have authentic screen brotherhood in the pursuit of their ideal, dedicating the best versions of themselves for what they truly love, that being racing. In the bigger picture of James\\'s \"Ford V Ferrari\", \\'racing\\' could be whatever is that meaningful to you. Christian and Matt give one of most their moving and humane performances.

His beautiful wife Mollie, played by strong compassionate Caitriona Balfe, is supportive of Ken, but so weary of working other jobs to keep the family afloat, including son Peter.Although, not classically studied Ken is the engineering savant. He amazingly diagnoses the imperfection of any car by just driving it. Yet, he\\'s the strident smartass, who is blunt in his assessments to everyone. That runs amok with superfluous Ford Executive VP Leo Beebe, played by slickly good Josh Lucas.Predictably, Leo\\'s egomania tests Carroll\\'s loyalty to Ken, who might be the best race driver on Planet Earth. That might be the lone narrative downside. Also given this historical retelling, we kind of figure out how things go. Just saying.Phedon Papmichael\\'s cinematography mesmerizes. Phedon captures the visceral impact of speed and danger in every turn in the larger expanse. Still, I was moved in the close up of Christian\\'s visage on the speeding straight away. The calm serenity. Ken gets who he is.My favorite scene: Ken looks at the picture Peter drew of the racetrack. Christian\\'s Ken meticulously describes what he has to do in each individual turn. Peter looks at his Dad in wonder. That\\'s \"the perfect lap\". Peter asks, what if you can\\'t race \"the perfect lap\".

As the movie opens, we see Carroll Shelby in a flashback win the 1959 LeMans. We then go forward a few years when Henry Ford II address the Ford factory floor asking for some good new ideas. Up-and-coming executive Lee Iacocca suggests buying the struggling Ferrari car manufacturer but the deal fails. In a parallel story, we get to know rebel driver Ken Miles.... At this point we are less than 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you\\'ll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from director James Mansfield (The Wolverine; Logan). Here he brings to the screen the heated rivalry between two very different giants in the car industry: Ford and Ferrari. The movie starts promisingly, but pretty soon we are bogged down in all kinds of corporate background and infighting that play out for way too long. Honestly, the movie could\\'ve been trimmed by 20 to 25 minutes in the movie\\'s first half, and would not have lost any of the movie\\'s essence. Matt Damon en Christian Bale are terrific in the lead roles of Shelby and Miles. The actual racing sequences are entertaining and loud, very loud.The movie opened wide the previous weekend, too great acclaim and box office success. I saw the movie in its second weekend of play, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. Positive word of mouth will likely result in continued strong business in the weeks to come. If you have any interest in car racing, or are simply interested in a well-made and entertaining movie (even if a bit overly long for its own good), I readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD or Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.',\n",

Perhaps it\\'s a wise decision by the filmmakers to forego a prologue showing Hank #1\\'s gun thugs patrolling the world\\'s first auto assembly lines, with orders to shoot any workers who dare talk to each other. Maybe it would be beside the point to depict members of this Corrupt Corporate Fat Cat Family chilling with Der Fuhrer, and providing technical support for the latter\\'s infamous Blitzkrieg. Possibly it would be too much of a tangent to incorporate references to Edsel\\'s Revenge, when Hank One\\'s favorite son was NOT given a starting spot by the Detroit Lions, prompting this petty grudge-bearing conniving clan to BUY the team with the intention of making it the focus of national derision forever. However, what FORD V FERRARI actually DOES put up on the screen should be enough to convince anyone (beyond the demonically-possessed ditto-head Pachyderm core supporters) NEVER to get behind the wheel of a fraudulent Ford!',\n",
       " 'Whilst very different along with the joker this is by far my joint favourite film of the year the first racing film I can remember seeing in a long time I felt like I was living and breathing the car scenes as the driver with the emotional oomph added by a simply sublime Damon and Bale made this flawless on every level. A real must watch!',\n",
       " 'I have never written a review here before, but this movie inspired me so much, I just had to say something. FvF felt so much like my all time favorite movie, \"The Right Stuff,\" I was duly impressed. The acting, the cinematography, the script and direction were just spot on. I at first didn\\'t want to see it because I absolutely hate Christian Bale, but his performance IMHO was Oscar-worthy. The racing scenes were exciting and visceral, the CG locations were perfect; everything about this movie just drew me in. I highly recommend FvF for the whole family!',\n",
       " \"Ford v Ferrari was a really special experience for me. I am not a person who is related to the cars, but this movie made me feel like a pilot. My adrenaline went crazy while I was watching the race scenes ( or should I say I was experiencing them ). Ford v Ferrari was like a virtual reality racing game. Cinematography, sound efects, visual efects and soundtracks made the experience so realistic. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are both GREAT actors and in this movie their performances are Oscar-nomination worthy ( especially Christian Bale ). In a nutshell, It's been an exciting and enjoyable 152 minutes. The directors and the actors did a great job and adapted this rivalry to the big screen. When I got out of the theatre, I was thinking about how much the audience need this kind of movies.\",\n",

       " \"Fun movie with two great leading men. Both are grappling with a tough industry while maintaining their own vision. Damon & Bale's portrayal of the real life friendship of these two mavericks is remarkably good. I don't think it's amazing but it is an enjoyable movie.\",\n",
       " 'Overall great movie with strong character development and a complex yet easy to follow storyline. Highly recommend.',\n",

       " \"The thing I kept hearing about 'Ford v Ferrari' was that even if you're not into the car racing side of things there is enough other stuff going on to keep you entertained. I can confirm that was not correct information. This movie is two and half hours long and the entire thing is about motor sports. If you don't like motor sports, this film will not be to your liking. You can appreciate things about it like Matt Damon and Christian's Bale's fine acting, but overall this will likely not be a pleasant experience for you.The film has been nominated for Best picture at the Academy Awards. I was a little surprised by that. I think it speaks more to a weaker year in terms of good films than anything else. This would easily be the worst of the nine nominated films and the least likely to win. It ticks none of the boxes required to compete for the win and is simply there as filler. If Bale had been nominated in an acting category I would have seen that as a more worthy nomination.The biggest problem I had with the film is that we are asked to side with Ford. Ferrari are shown to be scumbags - the only problem is that Ford are as well. So why should we root for them? Simply because we are told to? That was incredibly poor writing and something that was hard to get past. If you are smart enough to realise that Ford aren't worth supporting then you are left with 150 minutes of film runtime about something you couldn't care less about. The ending was cheesy and out of character, the film was predictable and the tone was uneven and hard to settle in to. This is not a film I would recommend seeing unless you are a motor sport fanatic.\",\n",
       " \"Text: It has adrenaline from start to end with touches of drama. Excellent tempo. Very good script and direction. Very convincing performances. It is accompanied by a very good music that immerses you along it. The movie lasts 2 hours 32 minutes and you don't feel them, it's worth it, you enjoy every goddamn second. I hadn't felt this way for a long time, and I don't know about cars and they don't attract me, but the movie is made with love, in addition to everything you learn from history with this based on real life. I could watch it a thousand times.\",\n",
       " \"Batman v Superman, Freddy vs. Jason and Kramer vs. Kramer, there's been plenty of battles of the heavyweights depicted before in Hollywood however, none of them have been as fast or as furious as Ford v Ferrari (or Le Mans '66 as titled here in the UK), an adrenaline fuelled race to be the best from director James Mangold.American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle against the corporation and themselves to build a revolutionary racing car for Ford to challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.Le Mans '66 does what every great sports film should do in making you care about the characters first and foremost while the sport actually takes more of a backseat. The racing is, of course, rather prominent however, thanks to a great screenplay and James Mangold's direction, Le Mans '66 becomes a thoroughly entertaining ride of courage and determination that makes for such compelling viewing.When the race sequences do come mind, they are as impressive as you can get, the ferocity of the competition really jumping off the screen, accompanied brilliantly by Marco Beltrami's pulsating score. It really is edge-of-your-seat thrills delivered at a blistering pace, the stunning visual effects and close proximity to all the racing action truly making this a cinematic experience to remember.Coming to the performances, Le Mans '66 features two great lead performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale, both lighting up the screen whenever present, particularly when sharing a scene. Throw in some strong support from the likes of Jon Bernthal and Josh Lucas, and Le Mans '66 becomes an even better film with a great ensemble on board.What makes Le Mans '66 work so well for me is that you don't have to be major racing enthusiast to find something to enjoy, James Mangold making an incredibly accessible film for all to enjoy. I found myself enjoying it as much as Ron Howard's Rush a few years back, which is not a bad thing, at all.\",\n",
       " \"Good ride! That's the best summary. Ford v Ferrari is a good drama about the Ford company wanting to out-top Ferrari in the race tracks. It tells the story of Chelby and Miles and their crusade to win the Le Mans 24 hours race.Damon and Bale are top-notch here. Great acting, great scenes. Might make you even cry.Soundtrack is good and keeps the tone of the movie.Movie kinda drags for a while sometimes... it could be a little shorter. Sometimes it's just some drama filler to build up for what we are waiting for: the Le Mans race.Nothing to say on the events credibility because I'm not familiar with the real facts, and that doesn't bother me as well. It's supposed to be someone's take on the story, and that's ok by me!Overall, I'd recommend it if you like racing and drama combined.\",\n",
       " \"I hate car racing but this long movie - nearly 3 hours - held me fixed to the screen. Superb acting, astounding cinematography and a great story made it worth every cent.And the cars; this was a time when cars were not seen as being evil as climate alarmists tell us but both works of art and amazing bits of machinery. But the real essence of this story were the men who built and raced the cars.I recently wrote a review for the reboot of Charlie's Angels which was filled with snowflake issues and PC writing. A fun franchise had been ruined. Ford v Ferrari however demonstrates that Hollywood can still put out a great movie which hasn't been ruined by woke points of view. There were no little girls competing with the men in this incredibly tough occupation and boy did the movie benefit from that. Carroll Shelby, played by Damon and Bale as Ken Miles, both legends of racing and cars were spot on in a masterfully directed bit of recent history. Having said that Catriona Balfe was superb as Bale's wife.One of the year's best.\",\n",
       " \"Le Mans '66 is a new sports biography directed by James Mangold, director of Logan and Walk the Line.In the film, the American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) is asked by car company Ford if he wants to make a racing car for the company, so that they can participate in car racing so that they can also sponsor their company in this car world. Ford also hopes to be able to compete more with the Ferrari car company. They try to do this during the 24-hour Le Mans race. To have a good chance against Ferrari, they also have to find a suitable driver. Carroll proposes to ask British driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to race for Ford. Ken Miles has a passion for cars and racing, but is also somewhat rebellious. For example, he does not seem the right driver to promote Ford in a positive way with their brand and new racing cars. Shelby and his race crew see that Ken is the only one who has a real chance to successfully drive the Ford race car and a real chance to win the race. Shelby and his crew now have to decide to stay true to Ford's rules with another driver, or to keep the race with Ken Miles as a driver, so they have a chance to win the 24-hour Le Mans race.\\nFor a true story, James Mangold knows how to tell the film in an interesting way. You also don't need to have any knowledge about car racing or the true events of Le Mans '66 to be able to follow and understand the story. You will receive the necessary information in the film. If you are familiar with all or a few of these things, there is more to enjoy in the film, because there are enough jokes and comical references in the film for the connoisseurs. The race scenes are also filmed as if you were in the car as a driver or passenger as a viewer. Thanks to the sound effects of the racing cars, it also feels as if you are actually watching a race or you are actually participating in the scenes in the car.The film is not really about the battle between car companies Ford and Ferrari. This is part of the film, but the film is more about the fight that the car designer and racer have against the company's board members, which they must keep satisfied. This film shows so beautifully how people sometimes have to choose to continue to follow their passion and own thinking. Or that they neatly follow the rules of the company and the manager, even if they have to put aside their passion and their own ideas. Apart from the race, they also know how to create excitement in the film with the different choices that the characters face. As a viewer you usually do not know which choice is the best and which is ultimately taken by the characters. The film also shows how heavy people are who are slightly different from society due to poor health or a developmental disorder such as PTSD. Despite In the face of these handicaps, they still have to follow certain rules of society, which is not always easy for them.The acting is also good and credible in the film. Christian Bale steals the film as Ken Miles a car and racing enthusiast, who looks with critical eyes at how others treat their cars or drive their racing. He knows how to share his critical opinion in comical ways with the other characters in the film. For this role he deserves to be nominated for various film prizes such as an Oscar. Matt Damon also does good acting as a car designer and later as the boss of a racing crew, trying to keep both the rebellious driver and the strict Ford board members happy. For this, he must choose one of the two, which often leads to conflicts. Although the two sometimes go against each other, they still have good chemistry thanks to their shared passion for cars and racing. The rest of the cast such as Josh Lucas, John Bernthal and Ray McKinnon also provide appropriate acting as members of the race crew or corporate management.\",\n",

I am a huge fan of Carroll Shelby, and especially of his awesome creation, the classic, 427 Cobra. He is also an automotive legend who, togeather with Ken Miles, made racing history. I can only say thank you, to the both of them, thank you very much!The film Ford vs Ferrari was truly exciting from start to finish (line), and I loved every second of it. Just as other great racing films prior, like the classic Le Mans with Steve McQueen, and Days of Thunder with Tom Cruise, it brings out the best of automobile racing. These films all capture the essence of motor sports, each in their own way, showing what it takes to be a winner, including the dangers of speed that follows.The film gets a perfect 10 in my book as I felt completely entertained throughout the whole film. I am not rating it on absolute historical accuracy, or total perfection when it comes to the art of filmmaking, but as an enthralling, riveting, really awesome, kick-ass movie for all to enjoy. It may be a bit much jargon for those with less interest in cars or racing, but stil, one hell of a flick!R.I.P. Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles!\",\n",

The story itself, which I was not entirely familiar with was OK, but there were some serious flat spots that made me want to turn it off.it also had a very anticlimactic ending, I was hoping they would show the car crash close up, instead it was off screen and in the distance.It was shot well, the race scenes were good, and the set design and streets transformed to the mid 60's was really well done.

Matt Damon and Christian Bale were so good as the leading pair as expected. This project started as Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in the leading roles but I couldn't think of anyone other than Matt and Christian for these roles. The movie has drama, comedy, great chills we expect from a racing movie, father son relationship, friendship, wife husband etc. The chances of this movie winning the best picture at Oscar's is few but it's definitely one of the best films I have seen this year and one of the two best racing drama's I have ever seen.

Ford v ferrari had these brilliant performances as well as an interesting story that is at its core about two men who are fighting for their passion being warped into the 'dick measuring contest' between two large corporate car manufacturers.\\nAs such, the film is brilliantly titled as to reflect the fact that at the end, the story that is recorded will always be the competition between Ford and Ferrari, overlooking the true heroes of the story, Ken Miles and Caroll Shelby. Ford v Ferrari does a great job introducing audiences who may not be familiar with the subject into the world of cars, not over explaining but, simplifying and focusing on what is important making is a very easy viewing.

       " \"James Mangold's (Logan/3:10 to Yuma remake) latest is a fun tale of the rivalry between the Ford car company & Ferrari on who's vehicle would win the infamous 24 hour LeMans race back in the 1960's. Ford enlisted Carrol Shelby, played by Matt Damon, to solve their dilemma which in turn caused Shelby to recruit his best friend/enemy Ken Myles (returning Yuma star Christian Bale) as his driver. Both mavericks in their own fields, Shelby the car maker/seller & Myles the perfectionist racer used their combined talents (& embattled histories) to take on the illustrious task of dethroning the mighty Italian carmaker (who at that point in history made beautiful cars but was in debt). Easy job, you think? You'd be wrong since Ford's underlings & marketing gurus may have had the right ideas on how to make a car look pretty (the '64 launch of their immortal Mustang is featured) but their know how on what made a engine tick properly was lost on them which fuels the constant fire between Ford & Shelby who wanted final say so on the men to race their cars (Miles was pegged as a problematic lone wolf) while Shelby knew he had the right man for the job. Never taking the Cliffs' notes approach to the material but savvy enough to make the car jargon fun & inclusive, this film fires on every cylinder (forgive my car punniage!) staying entertaining & even riveting when we know from history who wins the race. All the actors are in fine mettle including Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, Ray McKinnon, Caitriona Balfe (from Starz's Outlander) & a special mention to Tracy Letts (playwright of Osage County) for his hilarious portrayal of Henry Ford II.\",\n",

If I was stranded on a desert island with only 10 Blu-ray movies to keep, this would be one of them.Primarily, this is a racing movie. Le Mans is a very special race in the racing world. Using 2 drivers, they race for 24 hours rain or shine. Obviously, the drivers are very important, but the building of an ultra high performance car that is driven 100% flat-out for 24 hours is the engineering challenge.The movie also tells the fascinating story between Ford and Shelby. A partnership that still exist today, you can still buy a Shelby Mustang for about $20,000 above a standard Mustang price. Clearly, the Shelby name means something to people looking for performance.About 60% of the movie is amazing car racing footage. Having said that, one of the most impressive scenes to me is when Shelby gives Henry Ford II a ride in the Ford GT. Fords reaction, is incredible, and an amazing piece of acting. You might look at Henry Ford II as a stuffy Business Man, but deep down inside he is still a \"Car Guy\" and he was blown away with the extreme performance of a 220 mph car.I consider myself a movie buff, I have over 3000 DVDs and Blu-ray\\'s in my collection. I ONLY watch a movie one of two ways. In a movie theater or on a disc from my collection. I never stream. Most of my movies are from the 1930s to 1950s.

So it's unlikely I would have gone out of my way to see a movie so heavily focused on making and racing cars had it not been for the cast, the solid track record of director James Mangold, and the positive reviews.On the topic of those reviews- I'm not as enamoured with the movie as many seem to be, but I find this movie relatively easy to recommend to anyone who's willing to give this movie 2.5 hours of their life. This running length is mostly justified- it's a fairly large story but I feel it could've ideally been 20-30 minutes shorter, and for all the hubbub The Irishman has been stirring lately because of its epic length... I feel like that one justified its running time more.So the length and the subject matter weren't ideal for me, but highlights did include Bale's performance (wasn't he hugely overweight less than a year ago for Vice? This guy's commitment to the physicality of the roles he plays is INSANE), the racing scenes (they're tense as all hell, especially if you're like me and don't know the actual history of the events depicted), and the sound design. This movie has a really good chance of sweeping the technical awards at this year's Oscars, the same way movies like Gravity and Mad Max: Fury Road have done recently.Give it a watch I'd say, even if you're not a car nut. If you have a great home theatre and sound setup it's not a must watch at the cinema, but if not, it's a good one to see on the big screen.\",\n",

It's the most fun I've had at the movies in a while!I went in to this not knowing much about the story, but by the end I was blown away! I had no idea how gutsy (and sometimes crazy) Carrol Shelby and Ken Miles were! The film is flat out fun, not just because of the thrilling racing sequences, but also because of the at times laugh out loud humor scattered throughout too, (though not enough to be considered a comedy).Matt Damon and Christian Bale both each give two of the best performances of their careers!\\nThe racing sequences had my heart pounding with adrenaline and there were times I wanted to cheer!I could go on and on but really, do yourself a favor and go see this one, whether you're a car fan or not.

Giving such a movie 10 stars may seem excessive, but for this type of film I think it's perfect. The characters, both central and peripheral, are performed perfectly, and the film includes the best in-car race footage since Grand Prix. Side note: the sound systems in modern theaters have often caused me enough discomfort to cause me to put in ear plugs, but the sound of a full-race 427 at high rpm didn't bother me at all.\",\n",

Also got to know a bit of history about how Ferrari used Ford to get taken over by Fiat. Racing scenes at the Daytona and at Le Mans were well shot. This has to go down as one of the better roles enacted by Christian Bale post his tryst with DC comics as the Batman.',\n",
       " \"When it comes to cars we like them fast and furious, or at least for many that is the dream as handling the monster speed can be overwhelming. So that's where racing comes in, a means to extend one's self into the faceless visage of a Nascar or Formula One in hopes of seeing their heroes win. Yet, what goes into a racecar? For the die-hard fans and car enthusiasts they understand the mechanics behind it, but for fans like me, well there is a lot more under the hood of the vent. Today's movie is all about the battlefield of racing, though perhaps more of a look into the window of the past in the international racing venue. Tonight we look at the rivalry between two big car empires, in their battle for supremacy as I review:Movie: Ford Vs. Ferrari (2019)LIKES:Surprisingly Decent Pace\\nFunny\\nPlenty Of Character Integration\\nSeeing the Rivalry From Many Sides\\nThe Technical Jargon Mixed Well\\nThe Musical Score\\nThe Sound Effects\\nThe Heart\\nThe Finale Of RacingDISLIKES:The Predictability\\nLoudness\\nThe Drama Vs. Reality\\nA Little More Integration Of The Wife\\nThe Ending After The RaceSUMMARY:Biography dramas usually don't run at a pace that entertains me fully, but Ford Vs. Ferrari succeeded in this endeavor and put the pedal to the medal in storytelling. The elements of describing the business deals, politics and even development of the car are all a carefully blended together to be engaging without being overbearing for this reviewer. It finds a way to make all this business jargon funny, putting just enough spite, attitude, and stubbornness to work and masterfully relieving the dialog heavy plot. What impressed me even more though was seeing the character integration into this film, finding ways to make characters I care about and how I hoped the policies would not shoot them in the foot, which is key to helping me stay invested in a drama. Bale in particular was my focal point, his character having the most lines cast out and the central engine that drove this car. He plays the part well, adds that charm he brings to many of his roles, and then melds with the rest of the teams. Throw in all the dialogue filled with the jargon and you had me feeling like I was part of each group in the decision to battle the big boys.\\nHowever, despite all the heart of the film, most fans are going to want to know how the special effects department works in this film. Good news, for America's love of making things loud, bold, and powerful continues on this look back into the past. For guys like me, the musical score at times amps up the elements with its background noise augmenting the scene and making my skin goosebumps rise in that emotional way. Now add the layer of the sound editing and effects and you get the major effect of this movie. Those who love to listen to their engines roar as they fly down the street, or identify the clicks of the perfect transition to the next gear are going to love this movie. All those elements brought together with the theater sound drop you into the driver seat and gets the blood pumping. Finally, combine that with the visuals and you've got yourself a movie that somehow takes what many consider a dry sport of turning left and instead give you the dynamic element of being in this life or death thrall. When combined with the story, it's magic and gives a purpose to remain entertaining, which can be very difficult in a racing movie without gimmicks (comedy of the Love bug or action of the Fast and Furious).Despite the realistic nature of this film though, it still has some elements I would have liked to see curbed. One, the predictability of the film is still there from the foreshadowing alone, though if you know the history of this movie's plot you'll of course predict the ending (which I didn't). Despite the appreciation for the special effects, yours truly has sensitive ears, so the full volume of the engine roaring can be a little painful/ingratiating if not careful. These minor components aside, the movie's constant question of drama vs reality comes into question, and I feel there was a lot of magic integrated into the film compared to the reality. It adds entertainment, but I wonder just how much of this was true to paint the characters a little more notably, more so Matt Damon's character or the arrogant vice president. In terms of further character integration, I would have liked a little more of the wife, who though was involved throughout the film, felt there was a little more she could have had in here to really pull the film to full circle. My biggest dislike though was the last twenty minutes of the film, which I will not spoil. The film had another point that I felt would have been better to end, and while I understand why they did the last part in terms of closure, the last 15-20 minutes could have been edited down where I think the true story ended, wrapped up with a nice information card montage they do. It's times like these where the last piece is placed that sometimes throw me the wrong way, but I will of course recognize the honor and work they did do in those final moments.The VERDICT:Overall, Ford Vs. Ferrari delivered what I expected and more. It was a drama/biography that was not boring to watch, with a pace that like the car continued to work and immersed you into many aspects of the war between these two. A fantastic balance of story with technical prowess is going to be the entertaining factor for much of the audience and looking at the people around me during my showing should impress the target audience. Sure, it's predictable, a little time bloated, and loud, but the only factors are potentially the movie magic blowing things out of proportion and the potential ending that really had me bugging. Otherwise, outside of not being the most original idea or the most dynamic telling of a story it works for a trip to the theater.My scores are:Drama/Biography/Sports: 8.5\\nMovie Overall: 7.0\",\n",
       " \"Car movies are actually hard to do well, and car people are a tough crowd. Cars are harder to shoot well and they're harder to get people deeply emotionally attached about. This one was cinematically beautiful all the way through, had solid character development that actually got you attached to the characters, and the storyline was beautifully told with just enough detail to be unique, but not so much detail to clutter the storyline or distract and confuse the viewers. As a mechanic and occasional track driver myself, this is my favorite car movie to date and I've seen a lot of them.\",\n",

He tells his people to shut down the assembly line? and tells the folks that they are nothing and they don't deserve their jobs, and to come up with an idea to make ford cars better. Very bad stuff. The folks who assemble the cars and work on the lines building the cars have zero to do with the ideas for the cars and things never went the way the movie shows. The president of ford, and yes I know who he was supposed to be, would not stop assembly of their product for any reason, or they would close. None of those scenes ever happened or would ever happen at any company. I wish someone would tell me why anyone would talk to lowly assembly workers in that way and shut down production of their item. Silly poorly written, and ruins this movie. OK folks stop the line, I am angry at the stuff ford makes, and if you drones cant come up with something better to build then you need to walk home and not come back? Ok will move along.

       " 'The film also known as \\'Le Mans 66\\' provides us with a warming story centred around Ford\\'s desperate push to beat Ferrari in racing. \\'Ford v Ferrari\\' prepared the roles of the joint protagonists to be Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, however, a change in casting saw Christian Bale portray Ken Miles, an English race car driver and mechanic - and Matt Damon play Carroll Shelby, an automotive designer and former driver himself. The film, lasting for 152 minutes, begins in 1963, Ford Motor Company Vice President Lee Iacocca proposes to Henry Ford II to purchase the cash-strapped Ferrari as a means to boost their car sales by participating in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. At the very beginning, we see Matt Damon\\'s character driving in Le Mans, struggling to cope with his heart condition, despite going on to win the 24 hour tournament. Enzo Ferrari however, uses Ford\\'s offer to secure a more lucrative deal with Fiat that allows him to retain complete ownership of Scuderia Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari and Henry Ford II share very similar ambitions and in their attitude are very alike. Both capitalists in their business, thriving for profit and greed, Enzo\\'s success with Ferrari makes Henry envious, and displays a sharp, harsh nature towards his workers. In rejecting the proposed deal with Ford, Ferrari also intentionally insults both Ford Motors and Henry Ford. In response, a furious Ford orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby, who as mentioned won Le Mans in 1959 but was forced to retire due to a heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of Ken Miles, a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic. Ken wears his heart on his sleeve, has a passion for driving and expresses his loves his wife and son, his race car driving, combined with his work as a mechanic at his garage, wasn\\'t supplying enough money for his family, and his financial situation was worsening. Shelby and Miles test the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport, working out all of its design flaws until it is race-ready. Seeing that Miles is not their ideal driver, Ford opts to send Phil Hill and Bruce McLaren to the 1965 24 hours of Le Mans instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Fords finish the race. While Ford sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains to him that the GT40 instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari, as it reached 218 mph on the Mulsanne Straight before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the GT40 Mk II, but Miles is nearly killed when the car\\'s brakes fail during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe takes over the racing division, with the intent to continue the program without Miles, but Shelby gives Ford a ride in the car, leaving the Ford owner overwhelmed, and wagers his own company to convince Ford to agree that if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, he will be allowed to race at Le Mans. Miles\\' humorous nature makes him appear to lack etiquette and profession in the eyes of Ford, knowing that this is one of the biggest tasks that they have ever attempted, they are unsure if the British driver has what it takes. Ken is influenced by his family and the choices he makes are for them, despite saying his racing days were over, he found out how much he would be payed if he\\'d joined Ford and took part in Le Mans, knowing it would be enough to help the family cope financially. His son plays an underrated part in the film, Peter watches his Dad in every occasion, and shares a love for driving, aspiring to be like his Dad one day. Following the brakes-failure, witnessed by Peter, he fears for his Father, worried that the door may not open next time when a fire breaks out. Shelby saw something in Miles that not many saw, knowing his driving ability, he is convinced that Ken is the right man to take on Le Mans. Shelby is like Ken, an intelligent man who also shares an inclination to driving. His past experiences in driving and being made to retire early adds to his attitude, reasoning why he is very rarely happy, inferring he still wishes he was out on the track racing again. Shelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with NASCAR team Holman-Moody supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car\\'s limit to 7,000 RPM, and he wins the race, jubilation for Shelby and Miles and a foolish-looking Beebe reports back the news to Henry Ford II. On the night before Le Mans, Miles shares a scene with Shelby on the track, Carroll seemed to be reminiscing on his victory not too long ago, Miles shows no signs of nerves, more excitement to show what he\\'s capable of. If there\\'s one person to coach and manage you throughout a 24 hour race, it\\'s someone who has done it before, not only had Shelby raced Le Mans, but to win it, makes him the best man to coach the team. At the 1966 24 hours of Le Mans, Miles struggled during the first lap with a faulty door, but after team engineer Phil Remington fixes it with a mallet, Miles begins to set lap records while catching up to the Ferrari\\'s. the fast-paced sequence of tiredly racing, Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini - whilst piloting Ferrari\\'s new prototype 330 P3 - Miles experiences brake failure and has his brake system replaced replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces race officials that the replacement is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight until Bandini blows his engine, eliminating the Ferrari from the race. With the three Ford teams in the top positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Ford cars to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car photo finish. Shelby reluctant to tell Miles, but commanded by Beebe, explains the situation to Ken, who is initially against the decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap, slowing down to allow the other two cars to catch up, as ordered by Beebe. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, because in the sprint start to the car, his car was further behind Miles\\', but, the British driver is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans, Shelby comforts Miles and with regret, states he shouldn\\'t have told him (about Beebe\\'s idea), the two walk away from the Ford celebration arms around each other. Le Mans 66 may not have been won by Ken Miles, but he certainly dominated it, breaking track record after track record and being the English man he is, stereotypically enjoying a cup of tea during pit stops. His mastery in race car driving was apparent throughout the famous French race, and rather than dwelling on the end result, he followed orders and did what Ford wanted, knowing that there is more important things in life, a smile didn\\'t leave his face. The clips from Le Mans would go over and show Miles\\' son and wife listening in on the race with. When the family were informed by the race commentary that Ken had slowed down, Peter was confused and questions what his dad was doing, his mother smiled in pride, knowing that he had already won the race, and was doing what he had to do. Two months after Le Mans, while testing the J-car at Riverside international Raceway, Miles once again experiences brake failure, with his son watching on, the feature heads into slow motion as Ken doesn\\'t appear to exit the vehicle, he was killed in the resulting crash... \"Sometimes the door doesn\\'t open\". Six months later, Shelby pays Miles\\' widow Mollie and Peter a visit, and gives Peter a wrench that Miles through at him in an argument before winning an SCCA race at Willow Springs in 1963. Ford continued its winning streak at Le Mans in 1967, 1968 and 1969. Ken Miles was posthumously inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001. The sports drama film portrayed the life of an ordinary race car driver, who was happy doing something he loved, despite a bust up with Shelby following his short release by Ford, it was great to see the pair reunite not only as workers, but as friends, and that friendship is exemplified in the emotion shown by Shelby thinking about his Ken latter his death. The film doesn\\'t show Ford in a good light, rather pointing out its capitalist order and focusing on the Le Mans victory being all about the company, rather than the success of an individual. The photo attached shows the man who did what many thought he couldn\\'t do, a racing legend.',\n",

This movie did take some liberties, as most do, but not nearly as far as I assumed that they would.If you\\'re into any of the racing style movies (Days of Thunder, Gumball Rally, Cannonball Run, etc.) I suspect that you will enjoy this movie. Production and sound quality are top notch, acting is superb and I was concerned that I would have difficulty seeing Matt Damon as Carol Shelby, but he pulls it off better than I expected. The storyline between Ken Miles and his son Peter was a huge part of the movie which I didn\\'t know or expect, much of the movie is seen through his eyes but it pays off in dividends and doesn\\'t come across as cheesy. Christian Bale\\'s acting caught me a little off guard simply because I could easily recognize him but only because I\\'ve seen him so many times (Batman fan here).I purchased this on Blu-ray back in May (2020) and have already watched it about a half a dozen times because I find it to be such a good movie and will probably watch it six more times before May comes back around.Rated PG-13 but think that it makes a perfect \"Father/Son movie night movie\" for younger than 13 year olds due to the relationship between Ken and Peter.',\n",

But, per usual, it was Christian Bale that pulled me in. I set my pen and paper aside for later and sat on the couch to watch what I expected to be just another sports film. By the end of it, both my dad and I were a teary-eyed messes.There are some truly beautiful performances by Bale and Damon, and the chemistry between the entire damn cast is incredible. Caitriona Balfe is so charming as Mollie and I honestly wanted to punch Josh Lucas in the face the entire time he was on screen (in a good way, that means he played his part extremely well). The story was exceptionally crafted and the overall aesthetics were stunning. And the cars. Oh, the cars. You can't watch this film and come out of it without saying that you want to ride passenger in a race car like Henry Ford II.Truly, this two-and-a-half-hour work of art was everything I wanted and more, giving me hope for the future of cinema. It was so much more than just another sports film. It was moving, powerful, and goddamn hilarious when it needed to be. This is a film I truly think I'll watch again and again in the future-and not just to giggle at Christian Bale's real voice.\",\n",
       " \"What I enjoyed the most about this film is the way in which the film manages to present both the intellectual and emotional aspects of the story with such a clear vision. At no point do anything ever felt confused. In terms of the car design process and the racing it is perfectly clear what is happening and why. Then in terms of the corporate politics that are at play in the offices that too is written in such a way as to make it easy for the viewer to follow. This film is based on a true story, about which I knew nothing. One of the things I like is watching how much ego and marketing is almost sabotaging the project from the inside. When it comes to building and presenting a Ford racing car to compete against Ferrari at Le Mans, it's clear that everybody wants to win. It's just that too many people had different opinions about how best to achieve that goal; and whether winning the race is indeed the ultimate goal. As previously alluded to Ford Jr is a proud man, who cares about the company having a reliable image. Shelby and Miles didn't care so much about image. They just wanted to build and race the best possible car they could. This internal power struggle is interesting.\\nThe film is carry by strong performances, particularly those of the co-leads Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Damon's Carroll Shelby had the incredibly difficult task of having to play the game, managing not only Miles and the car design, but also be the middle man dealing with Ford himself. I feel like Damon nailed this role, demonstrating his great mix of dramatic and comedic chops. Bale's Ken Miles had to balance his passion for racing with his commitment to supporting his family; and it's that aspect of his character that I think makes the performance so impressive. Together I thought their friendship was excellent. The rest of the supporting casts provide good support. Overall, Ford v Ferrari is a well-put movie.\",\n",
       " 'Not as a racing flick, but as a movie altogether.The way Bale portrayed the daunting pursuit of perfection has brought this one in the group of films which can be counted on one hand that have made me shed a few. Damons delivery was also up there.Also more of a 8.5 rather than an 8',\n",

The races add a nice little tension and suspense what makes this movie stand out from the rest. The cast was great, with Matt Damon and Christian Bale in the leading roles. Christian Bale was excellent, probably his best performance yet, and Matt Damon just never disappoints.

This film, secondarily, teaches a lot about the American auto business --- and what\\'s wrong with it: How Ford could have been a real standout, long-term winner --- but literally chose not to be (in the long run). The story depicted represented a real win and technical advance for Ford, as a global automaker, but also reveals why Ford couldn\\'t stay at it and keep winning into the future, whereas Ferrari could come back and carry on.It\\'s a lesson in business that Tom Peters wouldn\\'t be ashamed to teach, in brief: \"Don\\'t do what Ford did --- except for one brief shining moment (when Ford broke its own rules and succeeded against all odds)!\"',\n",

       " \"Ford v Ferrari is drama based on the real story of Ford Motor Company trying to enter the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans. The film introduces Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a former driver who won Le Mans in 1959 & owner of Shelby American a vehicle manufacturing company which he founded after his career as a racing driver was cut short due to medical conditions. Further, we are acquainted with Ken Miles (Christian Bale) a British racing driver and a part-time mechanic. Miles has a reputation of being a hot-head and being hard to work with.The real story then begins with executives of the Ford Motor Company (FMC) proposing to Henry Ford II of adding a racing division to the company which will be helpful in increasing sales. Ford convinced with his executives' pitch agrees. Rather than build a division from scratch FMC thinks it would be better to acquire an existing racing team. A perfect opportunity presents itself as Ferrari is in the search for a buyer for its distressed company. Positive and hopeful FMC exec's reach out to Enzo Ferrari the owner of Ferrari with a potential deal. Ford expecting a conformation of the deal being completed, is informed Enzo Ferrari, after stalling their deal and using it as a bargaining chip has completed a deal with Fiat. Ford takes this as a betrayal and feels he was wrong done by. Vengeful Ford orders his staff to build a racing division on its own with the sole purpose of beating Ferrari.Then Shelby is approached by an FMC exec to build a car which is competitive enough to win 'the most prestigious automobile race in the world' & 'Grand Prix of Endurance and Efficiency', the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Shelby initially not fully convinced, that the level of success can be achieved as visioned by the executives of the FMC, still accepts. Shelby then tries to get Miles on board as its driver. Miles too having the same reservations as Shelby did, is convinced by Shelby to join him. The film continues with the two trying to build a perfect car and win the coveted race. In between there are multiple speed breakers that they need to try and find solutions for.The film surely keeps the viewer curious with the fascinating real story. Unlike other motor racing movies, this one focuses more on the backend workings of a racing team than the on track excitement of the race, which too is wonderfully depicted in the latter part of the film. The movie could have been christened better, as the title can be misleading from which the viewer may assume the movie to be a portrayal from a neutral point of view, focusing on both Ford as well as Ferrari, which is clearly not the case. For major parts the movie sticks to the real story, but includes a few fictional stories and characters as well, still it does not let down the viewer.Audiences may have been disappointed when Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt who were initially casted and replaced by Damon and Bale. Still both Damon and Bale do a stellar job in their portrayal of the real life characters. We surely have seen better acting performances from the pair previously, but still this performance does not extract any obvious complaints. The screenplay and dialogue is well rounded with what one would expect from such a movie. Director James Mangold too does a fair job, leaving very less room for disappointment. The post production effects could have done a better job, but maybe was kept mellow considering the time period.Taking everything into account, Ford vs Ferrari is great watch lacking any areas of disappointment. Motorsport lover or not the movie keeps the viewer interested throughout and surely deserves all the Academy Award nominations it has received.Acting- 8.5Casting- 9Cinematography- 8.5Dialogue- 8Directing- 9Editing & Effects- 7.5Sound & Music- 7Story/Plausibility- 8.5Storytelling- 8.5Rating- 9\",\n",

       " \"There is the age-old adage that fact is always more interesting than fiction. While a certain amount of creative licence is often necessary for plot development, a good old fashioned true story is one that leaves a lasting memory for years to come.Le Mans '66 is one of these films, and it is superb. Yes, the storyline deviates from the actual events at times, but the essence of the movie is in keeping with this pivotal moment in motor racing history; the glorious battle between a luxury sportscar manufacturer and the mass producer of automobiles for the common man. David vs Goliath, Box Office vs Benefits Office - you choose. Either way, Le Man '66 plays out as a buddy movie between the main characters, Carroll Shelby and a highly volatile Ken Miles and it plays out in a magnificent way.It's irritating sometimes to read reviews on IMDB, where 'self-made' geeks offer criticism which isn't fair or indeed, particularly smart. For example, I don't care if the Ford GT40 MK II doesn't sound like it has a 7.0 litre engine or the racecraft from the drivers isn't 100% historically accurate. Does it really matter in the scheme of things? The movie is an exhilarating roller coaster ride from start to finish with an exceptionally entertaining and compelling performance by Christian Bale who steps into Ken Miles's shoes with great gusto. Matt Damon plays Carrol Shelby at times for laughs and comes across as a passionate, cheeky salesman with an unwavering sense of self-belief. It's a killer combination.Like everyone, we all draw different messages and meanings from films, and the conclusion I made was a real surprise to me. I thought the film would be about taking on the big boys and beating them at their own game (which is the actual storyline but not the underlying tone). What transpired was something different - Ford tarnished their achievement by putting their big corporate multi-billion dollar machine ahead of the glory and legend of the sport. By not letting Ken Miles win and instead, instigating a cheap and cheesy publicity stunt to sell a few more units, Ford did more damage to their reputation that day than enhancing it. The words 'no class' spring to mind with the added hammer blow of not only robbing Miles of a much-deserved win but then tragically losing his life in a fatal crash while testing the next generation GT40.If you can ignore drivers staring at each other while driving at 200mph or the fact that Enzo Ferrari was probably not at the race (at that time of his life he rarely left his office, not even for races), then Le Man '66 is a petrolheads dream of a film. There is enough truth in the story to make it a compelling and riveting spectacle from start to finish.While Miles is not afforded the same stellar reputation when compared to a Fangio, Senna or Clark, the film successfully raises his profile as a racing legend which is fitting to his and the Le Mans GT40's memory.\",\n",
       " \"Kick it into 7000 rpm and enjoy a brief ride through history when considering watching this solid film, Ford Versus Ferrari. The exhilarating true story behind the 1966 24 hour Le Mans race serves as a story for the crossing paths between Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) and the eccentric British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and how they come together to take down Enzo Ferrari and show ford off as a top contender.Director James Mangold takes on the American story that rewrote racing history displaying some of the most exciting scenes we have seen this year in 2019. From the drivers POV to the spectators POV, we are taking a journey with all who witnessed this great victory and the events that lead up to it.As failing Henry Ford II seeks out an idea to save his late fathers company, he takes initiative to challenge Ferrari in a race of perfection by hiring Carol Shelby, designer extraordinaire of Shelby American. The issue for Shelby is that he can design cars , but he knows the best driver is Ken Miles, Who seems arrogant to him at first. Ken Miles is a car guru who spends his days either fixing cars or racing them. Putting aside there differences, we are found with the dynamic duo who creates the perfect ford GT to shake up the reign Ferrari has claimed for years.Put two all star actors together and you'll witness the closest thing we can get to time traveling following the bond between miles and Shelby. Matt Damon seals the deal on being a confident determined Shelby while Christian Bale displays another change physically along with his arsenal of character traits that help him depict roles perfectly. Up close and personal cinematic shots kept viewers eyes glued to the screen as we were passengers to Ken Miles amazing race. With this, and a strong supporting cast, and a great musical score to evoke emotion, Ford vs Ferrari scores an 8.5/10. There is a such thing as a perfect lap.\",\n",

       " \"I'm not a gearhead at all, but I really liked this movie a lot. The main reason was the dramatic, true to life clash between two automotive titans- Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari and the foot soldiers who fought the battle. It's really all about the characters, but there just happen to be some great 1960's Gran Turismo racing cars in it.In a nutshell, Ford's sales were slumping because 60's teenagers wanted more exciting cars. Lee Iacocca (later to become Chrysler's CEO) thought that adding some racing DNA to Ford would boost its image. So they transformed the Ford Falcon into the Mustang. Ferrari was on the ropes and Ford tried to buy them largely to acquire their racing team. Enzo personally rejected their offer as well as insulting Henry Ford II. That's all it took for the wounded CEO to drop $9M into his own racing program.It really gets interesting when Iacocca approaches Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) about heading up Ford's racing efforts. Shelby in turn ropes in Driver/Mechanic Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to work with him. The interplay between these two is really the heart of the film. Whether it's overcoming design problems or corporate bureaucracy, they are a joy to watch. Lots of little nuggets like a hilarious scene where Shelby's service in WWII as a B-17 pilot comes into play.There are many thrilling sequences in which vintage Ford GT40'S, Ferraris and Porsches roar around race tracks. On my Dolby 5.1 sound system, the growl of the race cars was awesome. Lovely shots of the town of Le Mans in France and its legendary race course. The climactic racing duel of Ford v Ferrari takes place in 1966 at the 24 hour race there. A real nail biter.Refreshing to watch a film where the story and characters move the film forward so effectively. For me, this more than 2 hour movie just flew by. Recommended.\",\n",
       " \"The movie is very well done: excellent interpretations, high quality from a technical point of view... The plot is perhaps a bit easy and unsurprising, with pat conflict between the Ford executives and Ferrari, and between those same executives and the car designer and pilot. It tries to be an underdog story, but it didn't quite work for me that way, given that Ford had more money than Ferrari and that their executives are kind of assholes.Still, they succeeded in making the two main characters interesting, helped by the good interpretations, and it was always entertaining. The more than 150 minutes did not drag the movie down.\",\n",

At its heart this film is a story of perseverance, of belief, of friendship, of teamwork, of dedication. So whether you like cars or not, you'll be able to relate to the key themes and messages of Le Mans '66. It's a great film. It really is a great story, with the fantastic characters of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles at the heart of it, two very interesting men who were well portrayed and explored. I loved the script as well, despite the fact that I didn't understand a word of all the car mumbo jumbo, I was still transfixed during those scenes, lapping it all up. There were some brilliant injections of humour in the script too, which worked so well and really added to the film.A large part of the success of this film comes from the performances which were great. Not surprising really as I've never once seen Christian Bale slip up in a performance - he's surely one of the finest actors working today. He really was the standout and it was hard not to enjoy his character and performance. Equally Matt Damon was fantastic, one of the better performances I've seen him in of late. The two of them had great chemistry together on screen and I'd love to see them working together again.The film also just had such a great vibe. That probably sounds a little vague, but its the best way of describing it. The direction was very slick, the camera work during the race scenes, the score and sound, and the overall tone of the film, all of them were spot on for me. Not to mention that it flew by considering the two and a half hour runtime. Always a sign that a film has nailed it pacing and flow and is edited to perfection!If like me you have no interest in cars, don't let that put you off a fantastic drama which ticks all the boxes.

Director James Mangold portray the movie with his own hand.\\nFor an basic overview, this film recounts to the tale of how the Ford Motor Company was battling during the 1960s and hence went to hustling vehicles to give their images a lift.

This film is really more about the relationship between Shelby and Miles, to that end the film did well.The acting between the cast is excellent but notable for the main leads, Damon and Bales did an excellent job but for me Bales portrayal of Miles is a bit off putting due to the accent he employs. Ken Miles was born in Sutton Coalfield near Birmingham so I was a bit confused why at points he sounded like he was from Walkabout Creek (circa Crocodile Dundee) and then at others as alumni from the Dick van Dyke school of Cockney acting. I realise no right minded filmmaker would want to make a Hollywood blockbuster with one of the leads with a Brummy accent as they all sound a bit thick (appologies to everyone from the West Midlands but you do have one of the worst accents in the UK if not the World) but the accent he used fluctuated throughout the film which was annoying.It's well worth a watch for the acting alone and hopefully it will encourage you to learn about the true story of Ken Miles and the heavily flawed Carrol Shelby that unfortunately Damon didn't really portray.\",\n",

       " 'I am not really into racing, cars, and never was and to be honest first I started watching just because of the renamed actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale,which have a great chemistry together and give the perfect energy to the audience the whole time, and to be honest that is really it about for the cast, the others seem like they are just added for the sake of it, like Ken Miles\\'s wife (Molllie Miles/Caitriona Balfe) and child (Peter Miles/Noah Jupe) both have like 2-3 scenes and that is it, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), the same, and the others are pretty much irrelevant (Character speaking not real actors), but in the end the movie is a biography and it really acts like it. The film from start to end is interesting on a high note because if you don\\'t know anything about racing it doesn\\'t really affects the audience and pretty much explains what needs explaining. The movie has a great energy to it and a true charm and after you finish it it gives you a good \"mood\" like a great storytelling biography should be and if you really paid attention from start to finish you will surely search questions from the real events in the past about racing like I did. In the end, it is surely a recommendation and a nice family movie which will get your mind focused on every aspect, especially if you never watched any race like I did.',\n",

Here it comes in waves, stops and starts, slow then rush and when a time out comes you take it! What a ride (pun intended). I don't follow this sport but now that I know what is behind so much of what I have seen and head about race cars, tracks, engines and the like I can see why others choose this for their past-time and pleasure. Racing scenes are up to par and presented realistically and one can only imagine the real thing. Keep in mind that only the crème del la crème reaches the top in any sports field and then they surround themselves with other like-minded pros and a professional competitive sports team is formed. This is the case here and aptly demonstrated. There are scenes where brakes turn red hot I mean who can imagine that? The closest we come is riding brakes downhill but they don't turn hot even though I have seen big rigs pull-over because there was smoke/smell coming from their brakes and tires. Also I never knew what Daytona was all about or Le mans either. And stop think about this. Building machines that can move so fast that we measure the speed via RPM's on a dial because we cannot track it any other way. I mean you can normally drive your car for approx 400k miles and 30 years and just replace parts here and there. These boys race a car into its useful life in one big race necessitating replacement of everything after race is over. Amazing pushing of the limits here. Recommend popcorn or sunflower or pumpkin seeds less you fingers make their way to your mouth and you chew nails for some scenes. Include a tasty drink too. Oh, and fasten your seat-belt....LOL\",\n",

It is superbly directed, write, acted, edited and crafted from start till finish. Running time 2 h 30 min ran like a wind because this movie was amazingly involving and paced.

There's no super sophisticated dialogue. Average people will love it, and critics will tear it apart. But it speaks to an ideal that many of us remember: when the U.S. created quality automobiles, when many people had work, and when being competitive in areas of production was important. It's pre-NASCAR, and driving LeMans is a different type of racing.\",\n",

The main duo vs. the suits is more engaging but it still feels a bit generic when it's not centered on Bale's passionate Ken Miles-it's that infectious turn (along with the strong music and technical elements) that steers the film away from mediocrity; every scene in which he takes the wheel (in both senses) shines.\",\n",

This film has some great racing scenes in it but it is more about the board room scenes and how companies battle each other.

The performances by Christian bale and Matt Damon were top notch and both their characters are throughly fleshed out. The storyline involving Miles's family was also executed very well and helped in further developing his character. The hard work done by Miles, Shelby and their team, in order to win the race at Le Mans as well as the constant interferences from the executives, form the central narrative of the movie. The movie portrays the contrasting perspectives of both these sides quite well. The racing sequences were directed magnificently by Mangold and keeps you at the edge of your seats. It was done primarily using practical effects and very little CGI and its impact is clearly feltThere are a few cliches that we usually see in biopics like this. There are also a few parts where we might find it predictable. But other than that, it's an engaging and excellently crafted movie that keeps you engrossed from the beginning, with well developed characters and a lot of heart\",\n",
       " 'From the director of \"Logan\", \"Walk the Line\" and \"Identity\" comes a true story about Ford\\'s attempt to take Ferrari from the throne of Le Mans.\\nThis film is an embodiment of a careless and fun experience. Because of the perfect pacing, the film manages to keep you engaged and entertained for 2 and a half hours.\\nThis film could be separated into two sections. The first one is a preparation for the minor races and the big finale. The second section would be racing itself. The first two acts are about the relationship between Damon\\'s and Bale\\'s characters. Although, it\\'s not anything new or spectacular, their relationship was very well executed and you could\\'ve believed that they were good friends. They didn\\'t show that at all times, but you could feel it because of the tight script which elevated both of their characters. Besides their relationship, the film focuses a lot on a behind the scene conflicts in a Ford company. Yet again, because of the script that ended up being very interesting. The rest of the film focuses on a racing, and I was actually surprised by how much runtime racing took. The grand finale takes almost a whole third act, and because of the way it was filmed, you don\\'t even notice that. When the film gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself into a racing contest, it doesn\\'t let go of you. That brings us to the best part of the film, and that was the way it was filmed, and also the whole production design. It\\'s impressive that they managed to almost completely avoid the usage of CGI. Instead, they shoot the racing sequences in the cars whilst driving. When you\\'re shooting that in a practical way, it\\'s easier to get the audience invested. You notice appealing camera angles, immersive sound design, production design and all the details that went into designing this film. One of the reasons why did they choose that approach is James Mangold, who is the creator of that idea. He had a vision and he accomplished to achieve it. He\\'s slowly becoming one of the most versatile directors working today. He touched almost every genre there is, and yet, he did not make a terrible film so far. Besides his visual decisions, he managed to pull out incredible performances from the whole cast. Matt Damon and Christian Bale were incredible. Damon in a bit subtle role and Bale in a showier role, both of them delivered. It\\'s a shame that both of them are being campaigned for a leading category at the Oscars, so they are probably going to cancel each other\\'s votes, but nonetheless, they were at the top of their game. Besides them, I would like to compliment Jon Bernthal, who in his short time on the screen put a damn good performance.This film is definitely one of the better technical achievements of this year. If you\\'re interested in seeing this film, check it out whilst it\\'s still in cinemas. Watching it in cinemas certainly elevates the experience, and it emphasizes the huge amount of attention to details.',\n",

Documenting the le Mans race of '66, this team has delivered a vintage classic that is as classy as a scotch straight out of the cask after maturing for decades!Set up in the 60's, the Ford Motor Company is in pursuit of a new design that will take them back to the glory days. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) gets a path-breaking idea from his marketing team to design a Race Car, like the legendary Ferrari. After failing in an attempt to buy out Ferrari which is broke, Ford decides to build a race car on its own and commissions Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) for the job. Shelby takes the help of Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hot-tempered British racer who is struggling to make both ends meet. While Miles's addition to the team adds tremendous improvement to the design, the Marketing Head Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) wants him out of the team. How Shelby and Miles manage to achieve the American dream of winning against a Ferrari at le Mans is the remaining plot.What fascinates the audience is that the movie starts like a documentary and picks up pace in no time to make everyone watch it literally at 7000rpm. Whether a person is into cars or not, the detailing given to every aspect of a race car and how it is tested and done is prone to give a 'car-gasm'. Christian Bale and Matt Damon will definitely be serious contenders for the Oscars along with Leonardo Di Caprio, Brad Pitt and Joaquin Phoenix this year. Their transformation into the role is top class. Another noteworthy character is Josh Lucas portraying Leo Beebe. While he is pure evil as a personality, he is a pure genius at what he does and how he gets it done. Thank God for this is just not a 1hr30mins affair.

To me, the ending is just super depressing without reason. A tragic ending like that should feel deserved, but it didn't. If the movie ended with Miles losing first place, it would been a bittersweet ending, but I felt like they had to just shove his death in there.

But above all they do not transmit anything, family situations, servility towards bosses, nor, how did he say any emotion.',\n",

You can\\'t yell at other drivers, and everyone is trying to \"out brake\" (what they mean is \"brake later than\") everyone else on every turn. That\\'s just part of driving a good lap. More time on the throttle and less time on the brakes means a faster lap.The movie is stylish, good clothes, cool music, but there\\'s a perfectly good documentary about the same events called \"The 24-Hour War.\" All those people they talk about in this movie are actually IN the documentary. It\\'s on Netflix. Hell, I had dinner with David Hobbs at the Chattanooga Motor Car Festival last fall, and I also saw Bill Elliott there. Those are real people who really risked their lives for the love of racing, not some actors playing at it.If you prefer to see the Hollywood version of the world, that\\'s your decision. But I prefer real life or real fiction. This \"biopic\" nonsense is merely the appearance of art depicting the appearance of reality. Some would say the shadows of reality seen on the wall of a cave.

       " '\"Ford v Ferrari\" is a new American/French co-production that is mostly in the English language and this could be one of the big players this award season. The director is James Mangold and with \"Walk the Line\" being a personal favorite (also because of the subject) and \"Logan\" that I also really enjoyed, I was definitely looking forward to his newest project. Mangold was not part of the writing team here this time, but it was nonetheless three people, namely the Butterworth Brothers and Jason Keller. But while none of them are rookies amymore, the only really experienced one here is the older Butterworth. Still looking at the film\\'s massive running time of 2.5 hours, slightly over even, it is not too surprising that there are three writers credited. Must have been a really long script. Now as for the cast, it is basically two names only: Oscar winners Christian Bale and Matt Damon. There are experienced supporting actors in here too and you will maybe recognize their faces such as Bernthal, McKinnon or Letts (plus surprisingly familiar faces from NCIS and Prettly Little Liars in minor roles), but nobody comes remotely close to the star potential of the two in the lead. But they are both Team Ford here and not one of them Ferrari as you could have guessed from the title. Now this is major car racing movie, perhaps the biggest since Rush from over half a decade ago and if you liked that one, then probably you will like this one here as well. However, we are not inside Formula One this time, but instead the focus is on a competitive racing occasion mostly that is probably more famous in the United States and less famous here in Germany. I am talking about Le Mans or (if you want the long version) the 24 Hours of Le Mans, even if there are references to other races too like the one Bale\\'s character needs to win in order to be allowed into Le Mans by Mr. Ford.So the movie is packed with racing references. However, there are other subjects too like family life, company policies and also the fact that riding sports cars will always be linked very closely to danger, maybe life-threatening danger even. Well certainly the latter. Even today, it is a dangerous sport and back then, it was even more the case. There is that memorable reference on several occasions that as long as you are getting out of the car you are fine. Otherwise... But lets not include further spoilers. Let me just say that the film of course stayed close to reality, so they had to include these developments at the end and certain other parts as well, even if a lot in here was fictitious and added for drama purposes. Which is okay. I knew I was not watching a documentary. For example, while Leo Beebe is not fictitious, but also based on a real person, I genuinely wonder how much about him in here was actually exactly like they showed it. If I was from his family, I probably would not be too happy about the way they depicted things. Aside from that, I thought it was slightly shallow and not too inspired how they depicted him as the antagonist, also with his sucking-up to Mr. Ford for example. The idea behind how he manages to \"steal\" Bale\\'s character his glory was good though and nice not to have a really happy ending. Now let me also add a few words on the two central characters. As for acting and depth, it is really all about Bale, much more than about Damon. We do not even find out about Damon\\'s family backgrounds and really the only thing we do find out about his background is very early on that he was a successful driver as well, but had to end his career because of health concerns and went into engineering then. And all his baitier scenes are basically also empowered by other characters like the carte blanche moment. It\\'s not a too well-written character and I don\\'t think Damon will get a lot of awards recognition here. If any at all. As for Bale, he may get more because he definitely has the better material and there is no denying he is also the more gifted actor. However, he is as always walking the fine line between really going all in and creating something great and going over-the-top and maybe for his character here he tried to make him too special. But maybe it was just my perception. Or the writing. For example when they are telling the guy about how it is not against the rules to change the brakes, it was a bit painful to watch how Bale was acting in that scene. But he has good moments too no denying and I don\\'t think many actors would have played the part better. Still I did not find him (or Damon\\'s character) as likable as they wanted me to. So all in all, I enjoyed the watch here. The film does not get close to Mangold\\'s (what I mentioned early on), Bale\\'s or Damon\\'s best, but this is just because their best is so amazing and not because this one here would be bad or anything. On the contrary. It is fairly decent and felt shorter than 150 minutes. I give this film a thumbs-up, albeit not a 100% enthusiastic one. Go watch if you like the subject or either of the two lead actors or both would be even better. I am writing this as somebody who does not care too much about racing anymore and never cared about Le Mans, so you definitely don\\'t have to in order to appreciate this film. It has from beginning to end some really nice attention to detail (just wanna mention one scene near the end when Mr. Ferrari briefly pays his respect to Bale\\'s character and there are many other scenes, also slight fun moments like the stopwatch etc.) that makes it certainly worth checking out. Go for it.',\n",
       " 'I only know a little about cars and I effing love it! Ford v Ferrari is a movie that non race cars fans can experience such thrilling historical moments and I\\'m sure they\\'ll enjoy it.I heard that this American sports drama was adapted from a memoir called The Carroll Shelby Story which was published in 1967 by Pocket Books. The memoir describes his days as a race car driver, the challenges, the victories, and the crashes--the worst of which he describes as an \"explosion.\" The memoir also discusses the genesis for the revolutionary car he created, the Shelby Cobra. In Chapter 21, Shelby describes his life changing win at Le Mans in 1966 with driver Ken Miles against rival car manufacturer, Ferrari. (Anyway, this passage contains a little bit of spoiler, although in fact, it\\'s not. It\\'s merely a flash info I got from wikipedia right after I got out of the cinema and mesmerized).I like the idea of how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the story. Their relationship in the movie is spot on, portrayed really good by James Mangold and his team. My only complaint about this film is that, unfortunately, their in-depth story (relationship and adventure) wasn\\'t dug deeper. We get to see the huge intrigue between two corporations. But that doesn\\'t ruin the whole story. This drama is based on true event of an unsung hero. I didn\\'t know all the true story until I watched this epic biopic the other night. I\\'m happy that I learned something from this movie. Even Matt Damon himself--in one of his interviews along with Christian Bale--didn\\'t know the real story till he read the script. The way I see it, this film\\'s not about winning or losing; this is all about \"achieving the goal\". I\\'m so impressed. It\\'s totally worth to watch.

Matt Damon is rather bland as Carroll Shelby, former racer, engineer, and Ken Miles wrangler. Tracy Letts, the playwright who wrote \"August Osage County,\" gives an understated but arresting performance as Henry Ford II.Josh Lucas, who was so good as the romantic lead in \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" plays a villain version of Leo Beebe, a Ford executive. I knew nothing about Beebe but I found his depiction in the movie to be cartoonish. The Philadelphia Inquirer ran a story headlined \"Philly Friends Of Leo Beebe Say \\'Ford V Ferrari\\' Gets The Ford Exec Wrong.\" The article quotes a slew of people who knew Beebe and who say he was a great guy. Shame on \"Ford v Ferrari\" for turning him into a cartoon bad guy in what may be the only movie to feature him as a character. And please make Josh Lucas a romantic lead again.Overall, a good movie, but not so good that it could keep me, not a car lover, fully engaged.

This would be as good as, if not better than, 'Rush' and 'Senna'.Great directing from Mangold (coming off 'Logan') throughout, with a nice balance of family time, racing scenes and the car politics.

It's an absolutely thrilling film that fires on all cylinders.Ferrari dominates the annual 24-hour race at Le Mans for much of the 1960s. Ford decides to throw their hat in the ring, in hopes that a victory at Le Mans will raise their struggling sales. The former racer turned car designer Carrol Shelby (Matt Damon) and his difficult, but passionate racer pal Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are both brought on to help Ford craft a car to get to the finish line.Beneath the technical polish and gloss of Ford V Ferrari, the friendship between Shelby and Miles is the heart of the film. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are a large part of what makes this film work so well. This is their first movie together and yet, they interact with the ease of old friends. Their performances complement each other. You get really invested in this on-screen duo with an absurd amount of charm exuding from the screen.We all love a good underdog and this film is a classic underdog story. Ford V Ferrari isn't just about the race at Le Mans, but more about the human struggles encountered to get there. Pride and jealousy constrict Miles and Shelby at times, but the rigid corporate system of Ford Motor Company poses a greater challenge. Ford V Ferrari is an expansive, mesmerizing real-life story that feels perfect for the cinematic medium.Ford V Ferrari puts you in the driver's seat with the racers, but not in the way I was expecting. The stellar sound design and mixing are some of the best and extremely transportive. They give the racing sequences not just an immersive quality, but a transcendent one. James Mangold's direction is excellent. He gives you sequences that put you on the edge of your seat and capture your gaze. More so, Mangold has a strong grasp on pacing. The film knows when to slow down and emphasize character and emotion and when to boost its engine and hightail it to the next scene. In a film this long, it's remarkable that it feels as breezy as it does. Even if you know this story start to finish, the skill, technically and narrative in which it's told make this ride one easily worth taking.I recommend Ford V Ferrari for ages 7 to 14 for language.

You pair him with the equally reliable Matt Damon and the well cast, sleazeball-ing Josh Lucas and you get a spot-on, co-starring team. Damon and Bale don accents and trade torque/throttle in Ford v Ferrari (my latest review).Ford v Ferrari\\'s true story goes like this: A car designer named Carroll Shelby (Damon) and a hard-edged race car driver named Ken Miles (Bale), try to best Enzo Ferrari\\'s souped-up automobiles via the 1966 Le Mans. In truth, Ford v Ferrari is a longing film that ends on a down note but it\\'s not without a touch of energy and the almighty whimsical.Ford v Ferrari\\'s running time flies by even at 152 minutes. Most of these minutes involve mild emotion undercut with some heart-pounding, endurance race sequences. If you like a superior sense of time and place, then Ford v Ferrari will give you your mid 60s fix. And if you wanna see a more sophisticated version of say, Days of Thunder, then Ford v Ferrari will make you forget about that commercialized, Tom Cruise vehicle (no pun intended).Directed by New Yorker James Mangold with its vroom vroom scenes shot at ground level, Ford v Ferrari is the type of flick that needs to be seen with the best movie theater sound system possible. Mangold knows how to film racing action no doubt. He avoids all the Fast & Furious BS and instead opts for minimal flash and loads of stash. Yup, it\\'s about the clamor here. You can hear the fuel burning, the tires screeching, the engine humming, the studs spinning, and the racers rubbing. It\\'s decibel, ear orgasmic.Now Ford v Ferrari does fail to fully flesh out its 2-3 main characters (that\\'s rare for a 2 and a half hour pic). And yeah, the film\\'s first half has a lot more collared, dramatic momentum. Still, with smooth direction by James Mangold, some capable editing by Michael McCusker, some sleek rides, and a bleached out, beach blanket be-bop look, Ford v Ferrari provides the viewer with an old-world night at the cineplex. Call it \"stampede for speed\". Rating: 3 stars.',\n",

       " \"My dad grew up watching and listening on the radio about Fords attempt to beat Ferrari and he would share these stories with me growing up. So this movie was a huge deal to me. The movie does a great job how much it meant for America to beat the unbeatable Ferarri but also how snobby of a person Ford the 2nd was to his employees. Christian Bale and Matt Damon's chemistry was the best part of the film in my opinion. Bale stands out the most playing the crazy driver who got the GT40 to 220mph! I highly recomend this movie if you're a car lover, or even a history lover. Great work!\",\n",
       " \"Ford v Ferrari is the most average and mediocre film to release at this point in the year. There is nothing great, good, bad, or terrible about this movie. It's just okay. But considering that great movies do exist, mediocre movies feel unsatisfying by comparison.The acting is by far the best part of the film. Matt Damon is amazing, Christian Bale is pretty great, and everyone else is just average, which is disappointing considering the notable cast. The child acting wasn't all that good.The writing is pretty unspecial and average. It takes the classic American underdog trope and does pretty much nothing original with it. There's almost nothing to say on this subject because of how little substance the writing has.The editing was alright but nothing special. The shot composition was alright but nothing special. The soundtrack... I've already forgotten everything about it, only a day after it came out. The adr was super noticeable and terribly implemented.Watch this if you are into racing or this story in particular, but for me it felt like a futile attempt at sweeping the Oscars.\",\n",

It is accompanied by a very good music that immerses you along it. The movie lasts 2 hours 32 minutes and you don't feel them, it's worth it, you enjoy every goddamn second. I hadn't felt this way for a long time, and I don't know about cars and they don't attract me, but the movie is made with love, in addition to everything you learn from history with this based on real life. I could watch it a thousand times.\",\n",

Only two of them are worth a second viewing (\"Treasure Island\" and \"Hostiles\"). Most aren\\'t even worth the first viewing. Great actors are the ones you don\\'t notice acting. You always notice Bale. The rest of \"Ford v Ferrari\" just kind of lays there. As the story went on, I cared less and less. Matt Damon does a nice job but it\\'s a wasted effort. \"Ford v Ferrari\" gets a pretty big yawn from me.',\n",

       " 'Overall, this is a well produced and well acted biopic. The historic story of how Ford was motivated to take on the 24-hour endurance racing circuit is very interesting, especially given how Ford came from nowhere to not just enter the circuit, but almost immediately dominate it for the four years they competed.Those details of how Carol Shelby and his chief driver Ken Miles teamed up to produce an historic pairing is well told, with one glaring exception. There is a decided effort to portray the Ford executives as clueless and entirely lacking in human attachment. Worse, most of those scenes are entirely contrived, and plain wrong.There is one very nice scene of Henry Ford II speaking with Shelby about how it wasn\\'t the first time that Ford went to war in Europe. The rest of the portrayals of Team Ford takes on a predictably negative and entirely stereotypical formula.Apart from that, the interactions of the rest of the cast is both interesting and faithful to the truth. Ken Miles was robbed of an historic first of sweeping the big three of the endurance races in a single year, and this film shows how that went down.The end scene between Shelby and Miles\\' son was especially poignant and worthy of the film. Add in highly effective editing and musical score that achieved a high degree of synergistic power in portraying the \"perfect lap,\" and that alone makes this film highly worth watching.',\n",
       " \"I can honestly say there is not one thing about this film I dislike. The casting, storyline, the cars, the soundtrack..... But the real treat for me was actually seeing the delivery of a first class Brummie accent by Bale. I note that a couple of other reviewers have said he spoke with a 'UK Northern accent' (nope, we're Midlands!) and a Cockney accent (seriously?!!). As a True Brummie I can honestly say this is the first time I have watched a film and actually seen someone act and speak like the people I know and see every day. It was so great to watch a film without the irritation of someone over-egging the accent and capturing the Wry humour. And the accompanying script was spot on for colloquialisms too. Overall, an incredibly moving, funny, poignant and utterly entertaining experience.\",\n",
       " \"Let me preface this by saying I'm not even a car guy. Not even a fan of racing, but this movie although a bit lengthy was good. Everybody turns in a remarkable performance and you forget you're watching a movie for awhile there. Would watch again every once in awhile.\",\n",
       " 'This is a very well made film, from the writing all the way to makeup, hair, and wardrobe. What stands out for me is the writing, which is crucial. There\\'s very nice character development which introduces us to the 2 leads and shows us who they are. Rather than just \"getting into it\" with no introduction, we get to really like the leads and want to join them on their journey and want them to succeed. Without this, all you have are pretty faces, production value, vfx, chase scenes, and gun play.The icing on the cake is an epic moment that punctuates the one leads character arc. It\\'s a moment that almost elicits tears.If you want to watch a great movie, which are few and far between, this is it.',\n",

Carroll Shelby & Ken Miles have to fight against interruptions from the corporate higher-ups, deal with their personal problems & the various nitty-gritties of physics, to build a near-perfect race car for Ford to go up against Ferrari, at the 24 Hours Le Mans race of 1966.Ford v Ferrari is a mind-blowing film. Director James Mangold has given us a movie, that perfectly showcases the lives & friendship between Carroll Shelby & Ken Miles. The emotional scenes & the intense scenes have been perfectly balanced with generous doses of comedy, throughout. The racing set pieces are the highlight of the film. You actually feel like you're in the driver's seat, with all the race car drivers. The experience is just absolutely edge of the seat & mesmerizing! Matt Damon is outstanding as Carroll Shelby. Christian Bale is spectacular as Ken Miles. Damon & Bale share this effortless bonhomie & camaraderie, throughout. Jon Bernthal is brilliant as Lee Iacocca. Caitriona Balfe is excellent as Mollie Miles. Josh Lucas is fantastic as Leo Beebe. Noah Jupe is adorable & perfect as Peter Miles. Tracy Letts is superb as Henry Ford II. The supporting cast is great. Ford v Ferrari is a must watch. Race to a theater near you, as soon as possible!\",\n",

       " \"Ford v Ferrari (titled Le Mans '66 in the UK and other territories) is a biographical American drama film directed by James Mangold and written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller. It stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale, with Caitriona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Remus Girone and Ray McKinnon appearing in supporting roles.In 1963, Enzo Ferrari was approached by the Ford Motor Company about a possible purchase. Conversations were unilaterally interrupted by Ferrari when Enzo realized that the deal included the purchase of Ferrari's racing program, a program that won the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1958 and every year from 1960 to 1965. Le Mans is the most The world's oldest sports car endurance race, held annually since 1923. Troubled by being rejected, Henry Ford II drove his racing division to build a car to beat the Scuderia Ferrari.The film tells how automotive designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles lead a team of American Ford engineers and designers to build a race car that can beat the legendary Ferrari. Finally, they produce the Ford GT40 for a 1966 Le Mans 24 Hour showdown.Ford v Ferrari excels at evoking the pure thrill of racing - 'a body moving in space and time', as one character put it - and is compelling enough in those moments to argue that nothing beats the thrill of competition.Matt and Bale stand out in their performances by becoming a duo and I remembered the movie Fast and Furious from the characters of actor Vin and Paul. And so my movie grade is 8 out of 10.\",\n",
       " 'Just back from the theater after seeing Ford vs. Ferrari and it\\'s totally enjoyable. It never dragged and never really felt rushed either. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are two of the most watchable moviestars we have on hand these days, and their interaction can easily be seen as the bedrock of the movie.The racing scenes? We get pretty well all you could wish from the famous 1966 races at Daytona and LeMans where the Ford GT Mk II made its mark in racing history. I think in screen time they add up to almost an hour\\'s worth of the 2:32 runtime of the movie, and they\\'re filmed as well as (or better than) any other racing movie I can think of. Full disclosure here though: I personally think auto racing is obscene most of all because of its flagrant waste of fossil fuels, and anyone who argues that it\\'s responsible for all kinds of auto design improvements is just blowing smoke. If and when this whole sport dies its inevitable death, good riddance.But OK, this is a movie review -- how about the cast? Matt Damon is just fine as always. He doesn\\'t exactly have \"range\" -- he just plays himself in any movie (like Tom Cruise) -- but that\\'s just fine. I have no idea if Carrol Shelby is really like that, but Damon is so comfortable and engaging in whatever he does that it always works. Christian Bale is much more of a technician, a method actor, and I\\'m sure he worked hard to nail the eccentric Ken Miles, the race driver and engineer/mechanic who values the pure experience of the business on absolute terms. It\\'s fascinating to see him work.Two or three of the minor parts stand out. Catriona Balfe (best known for \"Outlander\") plays Miles\\' wife and gives her some depth -- much more than just a placeholder. And Tracy Letts (as Henry Ford II), Jon Bernthal (as a young Lee Iacocca) and Josh Lucas (as the smarmy, vindictive corporate suit Leo Beebe) are all good. I don\\'t have any idea how much of the infighting and scheming within the Ford corporation shown here is realistic, though I suspect much of it must be fictionalized to amp up the drama. But it makes for an engaging night out. Have fun!',\n",
       " 'Christian Bale and Matt Damon are two of the most talented actors working today, so my level of anticipation was high for \"Ford v Ferrari.\" I\\'m happy to say that the movie doesn\\'t disappoint: it\\'s an engrossing, emotional drama that held me on the edge of my seat throughout all of its 152 minutes. \"Ford v Ferrari\" takes an obscure true life story and turns it into a heart wrenching and thought provoking tale of friendship, creativity, ego, corporate politics, and human ingenuity. I knew little about the facts behind \"Ford v Ferrari\" before walking into the theater, but afterwards I couldn\\'t get enough of reading about the real characters portrayed so well by Damon and Bale. In \"Ford v Ferrari\" these two are in top form: Damon\\'s charisma and Bale\\'s quirky genius spark amazing chemistry that carries the entire movie.This movie is masterfully directed by James Mangold: the cinematography is awe-inspiring and the racing sequences are among the best I\\'ve ever seen. As a filmmaking achievement, \"Ford v Ferrari\" is outstanding. I do have a couple of problems with the movie: certain elements of the plot were predictable, and a few scenes here and there weren\\'t fully developed so it was somewhat difficult to understand what\\'d just happened. But these are only minor flaws with the script that are outweighed by great performances, beautiful cinematography, and terrific racing sequences that should set the standard for future racing movies. 8/10.',\n",
       " '\"Ford v Ferrari\" is a well done and in depth long drawn out biography that does give good focus to the auto industry and how power and greed intersect with it. As it tells the true story of the legendary race in which Ford challenged Ferrari and would come out on top as an automotive leader.The scenes are tense and heart pounding often gripping with tension as the gear shifts on the lane, yet things also shift in life for industry and the characters involved. As showcased are the power struggles and corporate problems of industry like greed and doubt however when the Ford GT is developed it breaks the company free to win around the curb of the tracks!Most compelling and interesting is seeing the friendship form between car designer Carroll Shelby(Matt Damon) and hotshot race driver Ken Miles(Christian Bale) as despite the drama and thrill of the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1966 a bond and lasting and listening friendship is formed between the polar opposites! Overall good touching film of showing how fast speed won over many with love and friendship the film was really paced well and mixed with fun and drama for a near perfect finish lap!',\n",
       " \"Im a car guy, so I couldn't help but notice all the flaws in the vehicles (mostly the sound effects were completely wrong! the 427 Cobras have deep LOUD raw throaty power, the buzzy sound of the cars in the movie with the mysterious tuner whine sounds were disappointing. Christian Bales character was brilliant!! His enthusiasm for cars was addicting...Matt Damon just chewed his cud every scene, gum, food, whatever was in his mouth, chewing the entire time. One scene it seemed like he was borrowing from Oceans 13, (where his mom bailed him out of jail) same line delivery. He didn't even try to look like C. Shelby\",\n",
       " \"Before writing my review I wanted to answer those who criticized the movie for being historically inaccurate, come on guys this is not a documentary! Even the director said that it is inspired by real life events but not all of this really happened.\\nAnd for those who said that this movie glorifies Ford it doesn't by any means, at the time Ferrari had the top cars and racers so Ford envied them, so the movie does the exact opposite.\\nNow let's talk about why I adored this movie (and I'm not even a car racing fan):\\n1- The racing scenes were incredible, they are taken from inside the car so you feel that you are with Ken Miles in the car, it's very engaging and exciting.\\n2- The cast is amazing! with beautiful chemistry especially Bale, Matt , Josh Lucas and Tracy Letts\\n3- CHRISTIAN BALE! As usual he is unrecognizable and gives a wonderful performance. His character is so likable and unique and you really get attached to him.\\nI wished more people had seen this movie in theatre because movies like this are not made anymore and it really deserves to be supported. I guess the name wasn't attractive for a wider audience. But anyhow go see it now! You won't be disappointed\",\n",

       " \"For its stars, significant budget, and historical basis, Le Mans '66 is essentially a sports genre film that does more or less what you expect. This is not a criticism of it, but I admit approaching it thinking it would be a much stronger film that it was (in certain areas), although I still found it very entertaining. The plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by former driver Shelby and his 'difficult' British driver Miles, who are dispatched by Ford Motor Company to build the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France.In terms of drama, it is solidly constructed, but it is a bit practical and direct in what it is doing. The talented cast help the characters and scenes come to life more than they could have done, and generally they do more than enough to keep the viewer engaged and entertained between what are the main selling points of the film - the sports action. The races are excellent in how they are delivered and how they translate the tension and experience to the audience - I've gone off motor racing over the years but was easily into this as it played out. The dedicated to detail and correctness in the main events of the story telling also help, and it feels like a satisfyingly solid film. The production design adds immensely to the quality feel of the film - the sense of period and place is there in all the detail.It should be approached as a sports genre film, because that is what it is, but it is a very strong and well-crafted one throughout.\",\n",
       " \"I'm pretty sure I could watch this movie every single day of my life and still never get tired of it. It's so good. It's such a pleasant watch and has become one of my ultimate comfort films. Just watch it, there's pretty much no reason not to like this movie.\",\n",
       " \"It's also too neat. It's so neat that there's almost no fault in all aspects of script photography editing. It's so neat that there's hardly any unique authorship. Deliberately dramatized with true feelings, suitable for the students of film academy to watch.\",\n",

I really wasn\\'t expecting much going into this film, and my only incentive to watch was Christian Bale, but Ford v Ferrari was a truly entertaining film. Now, I am nowhere near a \"car person\", in fact I had no prior knowledge about anything at all that takes place in the film regarding cars and racing but I was so invested in the story and the charming chemistry between Bale & Damon. So if you are like me and could care less about car companies and racing, do not stray away from this film because of that. I really wish I would have seen this film in theaters because it\\'s perfect for the big screen. It\\'s intense and incredibly captivating. I found myself in awe of the superb editing in this film and also the production design and the cinematography. If it weren\\'t for the excellent script and Bale and Damon\\'s, often hilarious, back and forth the film may have flopped but I am so happy it didn\\'t. Out of all the Best Picture nominees this year, Ford v Ferrari isn\\'t my favorite but it is absolutely a blast and a film I believe anyone can enjoy, even if cars and racing are not your cup of tea.',\n",
       " 'I know I\\'m the bad guy when I say this, but I honestly thought it was just fine. Not great, but fine.I liked all aspects of the movie except the script. I\\'m a shelby Cobra/GT fan, I like cars, I like racing, I even like Le Mans specifically so I\\'m a sucker for this kind of thing.That said there many times in the film where they really amp up the sports drama cliches so much that by the end of I was starting to get irritated.There\\'s a part where Ken Miles says something to effect of \"We have to dump the engine, it\\'s no good if we can\\'t break\" and his wife in the background goes \"but isn\\'t the whole point of it the power?\" and I actually groaned out loud. Not so much that his wife isn\\'t an expert, but that the director felt like his audience was too stupid to be following along at this point...and that kinda thing happens throughout the whole movie. There\\'s many times where the same line gets repeated a couple times to make sure the audience understands whats happening I guess, but I feel like they aren\\'t giving the audience enough credit.They also included an unnecessary mustache twirling villain that comes in every few minutes to try to foil the plans of the heroes, but it doesn\\'t really make any sense because it\\'s in his best interest for them to succeed. He\\'s literally being paid to make sure they win. It gets pretty hokey at times.Despite both Damon and Bale being all kinds of great, Bale morphs into Ken Miles near perfectly, I can\\'t give it an 8/10 because, while its a cool time waster and especially nice to see the cars on screen, I thought as whole it was just fine. Not great, but just fine.',\n",

       " \"Undoubtedly one of the best film of 2019 Ford v Ferrari is a sports drama based on true story as stated in premise. The film showcases the perfect blend of thrill whether it's the race track or the corporate clashes. Racing scenes are all that one can anticipate but the sound and performance by Christian Bale makes those parts of the story very much likable. On the other side the part which I personally liked was the Corporate side of the story that how it all started with simple negotiation with Ferrari ended in humiliation and how it motivates Ford to built its own fastest sports car and in that journey how men in Suits exploits their power with their nonsensible ideas to please their Bosses at the cost of compromising the sheer talent and their due credit. Matt Demon Aced his role as balancing the Corporate and field business and has given proper support as an empathetic friend to Bale to which I say both actually complimented each others role which helped them to pull off the emotional drama which makes this movie an entertaining yet emotional sports drama\",\n",
       " \"I'll be honest, I'm rarely emotional watching movies. Somehow this proved to be an excellent, worthwhile exception. You can almost smell the gasoline and burning tire in the race sequences. Matt Damon and Bale outdo themselves bringing the characters to life. The cinematography is marvellous, and low cameras, zoomed in faces and out of focus long shots bring depth and perspective to scenes.A visual tour de force well worth enjoying.\",\n",

Had it not been for the rave reviews, I wouldn't have sought this one out.The story itself is relatively straight forward, and the outcome not a particular surprise. This film could easily have fallen into mediocrity, however it just so well made. For the entire film, there barely seems a scene or a word out of place. On top of this, it looks amazing. I can't recall a film that, while not dealing with typically spectacular visuals, just looked so good.The acting is outstanding, especially Christian Bale, who gives I think his best performance, in a fantastically nuanced job. Matt Damon is good and the rest of the supporting cast generally spot on. Overall very highly recommended, one of the most professionally made films I've seen in a long time.\",\n",

For most people though, this is an enjoyable movie as Bale and Damon are on top form. Motor racing fans will love the racing scenes with good close up action featuring legendary Fords, Ferraris, and Porsches. At around two and a half hours, the overall pace should have been a bit faster, after all it is about racing! As always, many reviews here on IMDB make interesting reading, just don't believe the very negative ones.\",\n",

It's easy to follow and you need very little knowledge of motoring to understand what's going on.Christian Bale and Matt Damon are excellent in their roles.

The characters stand up soon after appearance. The look, tone, acting skills are really explosive, and Matt is also very good. I guess it is a change in history. I guess Bell will die, but I do n't know when it is, so I watched in the second half. I was afraid he would hang up without paying attention. Fortunately, after running the game, although it was best to compromise, it was also very good. His wife said that he had matured, and the carnival before he slowed down was probably the last time he was presumptuous before he matured. At that time, I believe he knew the pressure of his life and his wife and children to raise. Enjoyed great glory and became a great driver, but he still chose to do his duty as an ordinary father and husband, keep the job and support his family. Although he was put together in the end and did not win the championship, it didn't matter, at least all Everyone knows that he is the first. A person who does n't like the racing theme very much, it looks good, looks good, looks good!\",\n",
       " \"Normally, i expect with 2.5 hour movie with some part that i skipped it. But every minute of this movie is enjoyable. That ending though, kinda let me down. I have no problem that miles didn't win the race. But c'mon, he literally own the race by broke the lap record. Instead congratulate him, people that watching there running to the fake winner. Aside that, fantastic movie.\",\n",
       " 'It always amazes me when a producer/director can pack so much quality film into a mere two and a half hours with so much gusto and still maintain the gist of a historical and inspirational true story. Great cinematography combined with pitch perfect (location shoots in Italy) LeMans style car racing and an audio sound that makes you feel like you are at the track side with the roar of the engines and the squeal of rubber burning.It stars a great cast and the film is over almost as quick as one lap of the LeMans race track. Vrooom Vroooom Vroooom',\n",
       " \"Carol Shelby and Ken Miles getting together to build a car, racing car for Ford to beat Ferrari in Le'Mans. It shows if you know your thing, you can actually turn that into gold. Using knowledge of physics, cars, driving; these two do build the car, and a great one too.\\nIt also shows Ken Miles' journey from the short tempered and loner to a team player and fan favourite.\",\n",
       " \"Excellent true story about how ford beat(took revenge) ferarri in 24 hours le man after ferarri pulled out of a deal to sold ferarri to ford and instead sold it to Fiat.\\nCristian Bale and Mat Damon were execellent in their characters.\\nRaces looked amzingly real. Direction,cinematography,editing were great too.\\nIt's worth the time and you will not be disappointed.\\n8/10\",\n",
       " 'James Mangold happens to be one of my favourite directors, and not just because of what he was able to do with the Wolverine franchise. I love his ability to infuse a sense of heart into every frame. It helps that he\\'s working with great actors and manages to coax their best performances out of them.Granted, Christian Bale\\'s accent is all over the North of England, but ultimately it doesn\\'t matter, because you believe him as this passionate and difficult race car driver. This is also one of Matt Damon\\'s best performances. It\\'s easy to see why this was nominated in 2019 for best picture because it\\'s both crowd-pleasing and a rock-solid piece of filmmaking.The supporting cast shouldn\\'t be discounted either. Tracy Letts, once again, turns in a stellar performance, and Jon Bernthal plays against type as Lee Iacocca and it pays off.Some may dismiss it as a \"dad\" film, but for me, it\\'s the finest \"dad\" film in awhile.',\n",
       " 'This is a movie that tributes to some men who lost their names in the history boiler, actually shows the amateur spirit of the racing sports. With limited material support on their individual account compared to todays billion dollar budget business of race sports, Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby takes effort to win a most important racing event in the world. Even you are not a huge fan of motor sports you would enjoy this movie like I did on \"Moneyball\", \"42\" or \"Field of Dreams\" even I don\\'t like baseball. Christian Bale and Matt Damon will assure you that you enjoy the movie while you\\'re watching it.\\nBesides the great actors\\' performances, you will like the cinematography, effects and the intriguing story that tells the rivalry between two big car and motor companies Ford v Ferrari as they give their name to the movie. A Nice and satisfying action and drama you have to watch.',\n",
       " \"I love true based movies and this is also a special movie of this type!It doesn't need to be a car lover to enjoy this movie! Another outstanding performance from Christian Bale and Mat Damon\",\n",

       " \"One of the most favorite genres of film has always been the sports film. Inevitably those films almost always revolve around the struggle of the little guy against the giant, be it the favorite team to win or the corporation trying to stomp out the individual. One of the least popular sub genres in this category has been the racing film. Only a handful have been successful. To that list we must now add FORD V FERRARI.The film opens with driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) winning the Le Mans in France in 1959. Due to health issues he can no longer drive and sets up his own car company, Shelby American. Years go by and at Ford's owner Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) is upset because Ford has yet to come up with a successful sports car. Prompted to push for something new Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) suggest they look at the youth marker which appreciates foreign cars.Ford attempts to buy out the now bankrupt Ferrari but it's merely a ploy for Ferrari to raise their value before selling to Fiat and insulting Ford. This pushes Ford II to appoint a team to create a new car to race on the circuit, especially at Le Mans. The man Iacocca suggests lead that team is Shelby.But Shelby has people to bring along as well. One of those is Ken Miles (Christian Bale), perhaps the best driver in the world but one with a reputation for being difficult to work with. Early on we see this when the two have a disagreement. But if anyone can pull the best out of Miles it's Shelby.They go to work, assemble the best there is at designing their new car and find themselves butting heads with the Ford team at the start. This team uses computers and gadgets to measure things. Shelby and Mile's team knows their car, inside and out. A bit of ribbon and duct tape and they can prove the point they want to make as opposed to scouring through hours of computer data. This results in them all working together towards a common goal.This team creates the first major racing car for Ford, the GT40 Mk I. But not everyone at Ford headquarters is on the same page. Executive Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) is more concerned about advancing his career and does what he can to throw a wrench in the works figuratively. He convinces Ford to not include Miles on the team. Miles predicts that none of the Fords in competition at Le Mans will win and his prediction comes true.When Shelby is called on the carpet by Ford to explain why they lost to Ferrari, he explains in no uncertain terms that it wasn't the car that was the problem as much as not having the right driver. To prove his point he makes a deal with Ford. Let them continue to work on the car and if Miles can't win the race at Daytona, he'll sign over his entire company to Ford.Miles does win and it looks like everything is a go for both Shelby American, Ford and Miles. But once again Beebe inserts himself in a position he knows nothing about. He's wrangles his way into the head of the foreign racing team for Ford and seems bound and determined to put Miles in his place rather than allow the team to succeed.It all boils down to the second year at Le Mans with the new Ford GT40 Mk I and Miles onboard as one of the drivers. The 24 hour race commences and it isn't long until Beebe tries to derail the team. This time though Shelby refuses to bow down and keeps things moving properly. Now it's up to the team and Miles to make Ford a name to be reckoned with in the racing world.Racing fans will know the outcome of the film. Not being a race fan I came at the film from a different perspective. What I walked away with was having watched a movie that was amazing from start to finish. The film might include some amazing race photography but it doesn't focus only on that like many racing films do. Instead it tells the story of two men and their struggles to achieve a united goal of winning Le Mans in a car that they were responsible for creating.Both Damon and Bale add two more roles to their already long list of accomplishments. How neither won for their performances here is beyond me. The heart and soul of these two men is on display here in the film and it draws the viewer in rooting for them until the final moments of the film.I missed this one in the theaters, not really wanting to see it that bad. They should have promoted it more. It was truly one of the best films of the year and deserved more attention. With it available on disc now is your chance. This should be the one you look for this weekend.\",\n",
       " 'This kept my interest all the way thru. Even spiced up and glamorized for Hollywoods sake never caused me once to say as I always do \"C\\'mon, I mean really\"... except maybe when Henry Ford II started balling like a baby. Hard to understand Bales English accent at times still wasn\\'t even to much a bother since you were already so gripped in the movie by then. Damon pulled off the perfect car guy character and Fords top henchmen pulled off their roles as well. Very watchable movie and I know you will enjoy it too. Worth the watch.',\n",
       " \"This movie was great, it felt like I was in a car the whole movie! On a serious note - This movie is well worth a watch, an epic rivalry, awesome acting and brilliant directing. You'll be wanting to go 150 on the highway after you watch this movie!\",\n",
       " \"It's just another dramatic portrayal of an already interesting story. The movie is entertaining but you can get more out of reading Wikipedia. I sound cynical but there is more to film than this.\",\n",
       " 'A popular film among audiences and winner of 2 Academy Awards, Ford v Ferrari appears to be a sleeper hit of 2019. It tells the true story of Caroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they work to get the Ford Motor Company a seemingly impossible victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. The performances from Damon and Bale are very good, giving us two easily likeable characters. It has these two determined men as they face opposition not only from the demand of making the fastest car in the world, but also from executives from the Ford Motor Company. Despite what the title may think, Ford is made out as a villain of sorts, even more than Ferrari. This isn\\'t as much the story of Ford\\'s upset of Ferrari as much as it is Shelby and Miles\\' upset of Ferrari.What\\'s best about this film is that it isn\\'t as much a Rocky-esque underdog story as it is a story of passion. Ken Miles was satisfied with the outcome of Le Mans, even though he got cheated out of his rightful place at #1. He got his chance, he knew in his heart that he won, and that\\'s what matters to him. Not only that, but there\\'s the passion of Shelby to make the car to win the race while the corporate people at Ford just want the glory associated with winning. It\\'s as much \"Shelby and Miles v Ford\" as it is \"Ford v Ferrari.\"The racing sequences are practically perfect, even from the perspective of someone who doesn\\'t watch car racing. They\\'re intense, fun to watch, and show excellent camera work. Most importantly, they capture the thrill of the race, aided through the movie\\'s editing, which is as fast paced as the cars themselves. The film\\'s editing is perfect. It didn\\'t get the Oscar for nothing. Speaking of Oscars, it also won one for Sound Editing, which was also well deserved. The sounds of the race do their part to add to the thrill, a perfect combination of flawless editing.Ford v Ferrari is an excellent film that serves as one of the most satisfying films of recent years. It\\'s a perfect blend of story, character, and fantastic racing sequences. This is a must watch for car buffs, but also a definite recommend for anyone.',\n",
       " \"From the trailer (if you didn't know the back story) I could expect just another movie about racing. But it turned out to be so much more: true friendship, double standards of corporate world and just people, passionate about their work.\\nBrilliant work of actors also!\",\n",
       " \"A slick, thrilling look back at the golden age of auto racing. Ford v Ferrari is an old-fashioned film, not only due to the fact it takes place in the mid-60's but also in the way it is directed, the story being told, and the experience delivered in the theatre. The film is a tip of the hat to old-school movies about people with real-life problems. Well-directed, well-written, well-delivered.\",\n",
       " \"I'll start by saying that I am more of a casual fan of racing (Love rally racing though) , I do adore cars however. ( I adored seeing the Chevy racing team with their Corvettes early on in the movie)\\nEven if you have no love or interest in either of these, it should still not dissuade you from seeing this movie.The acting is top notch, as you would expect with Bale and Damon at the helm, but the whole cast is stunning. The story is based on the 1966 '24 Hours of Le Mans', and the resounding duel between the all-American, yet struggling Ford racing team and the already legendary Italian Ferrari team.I won't go to much into the plot but, I left the cinema for the first time in awhile feeling fulfilled by a movie, the visuals are excellent the cars and settings accurate and there was clearly oodles of love and adoration poured into this movie.\\nThe racing scenes are the highlight, they are incredibly tense and gripping,making the rivalry between the 2 companies come to a very satisfying boil and conclusion.If you don't understand the love many of us have for cars and racing, this movie will make you understand. It makes me truly happy seeing the passion and love for motor-sports and cars in general being shown by the characters and clearly present in the writers. Bale's performance in particular, almost makes you want to pick up wrench and head for the garage yourself. These characters live and breathe cars and you can feel it.Highly recommended to all audiences.Please Hollywood, more passionate film making like this.\",\n",
       " \"I was trembling after the win at Daytona. I was angry after Le Mans. I went through a lot of emotions watching this movie, and I loved it.\\nAnd then there's Christian Bale. This was a Matt Damon movie, you know, till Bale comes on-screen. He swoops in like the thief he is, and steals the screen from Damon!\\nIf you love your car, love how this machine becomes one with you, understands even the little bits of adjustments you make, and obeys, this movie is for you. If you just let your car run free, let it be the master, you will love this movie. Hell, if you don't love cars, I dare say you will love this movie.\",\n",
       " \"I have to say that I'm by no means a racing fan. I came into the movie with relatively low expectations (mostly because I found the name lame) even being such a Bale and Damon fan.What I found was a beautiful film that gets to be intimate, profound and sincere at moments. A film with an impeccable sound mixing, a thrilling OST that submerges you into the race and conveys a feeling of weightlessness, freedom and victory I hadn't felt in a long time.I profoundly recommend it to everyone reading this, specially for racing fans, as I've heard it's really faithful to the true story it's based on.\",\n",
       " \"What a fantastic movie, I don't even like racing movies but I love this one! Great actors and soundtrack, Matt Damon and Christian Bale classic, also gotta love the era! Have watched this movie twice and would watch it again if I had to! Highly, highly recommend this movie! Don't miss out!\",\n",
